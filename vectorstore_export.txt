bably wouldn’t be a need for dehumidification!The atmosphere contains water vapour in varying degrees at different times of the year, more when the weather is hot, and less when the weather is cold.In fact the amount of water vapour that can be held by air varies disproportionately as the temperature changes, as shown on the psychrometric chart. For instance, the maximium water vapour that can be held at different temperatures (where the relative humidity will be 100%) is:-50C 	=  2.48g/kg00C 	=  3.77g/kg50C 	=  5.39g/kg100C 	=  7.60g/kg150C 	= 10.60g/kg200C 	= 14.62g/kg250C 	= 19.99g/kg300C 	= 27.09g/kg350C 	= 36.47g/kgWhen allowing for the weather variations, the load calculations and the dehumidifier selection need to take this into account.

Several factors need to be allowed for during these processes, and the following is a guide to consider.ProcessIn the UK we typically will consider an ambient design condition equal to 300C 13g/kg, 48%rh, for process applications, although in some cases the customer may advise his own design condition to work to. In most process applications, the temperature also has to be controlled.For these applications, it is likely that a space, or a condition to be controlled, will be at a specific condition, such as 200C 25%rh and 3.

applications, the temperature also has to be controlled.For these applications, it is likely that a space, or a condition to be controlled, will be at a specific condition, such as 200C 25%rh and 3.59g/kg. so the condition and moisture content will be fixed, and the load calculations for the dehumidifier selection will be based on the worst ambient, say for 300C 13g/kg.However, the air for reactivation will be variable throughout the day, and could be at a lower temperature but with the same moisture content of perhaps 180C at 100%rh.This is the condition that will also enter the reactivation cycle, and as the reactivation heater duty is fixed, the reactivation temperature will be lower, and could affect the performance.

 100%rh.This is the condition that will also enter the reactivation cycle, and as the reactivation heater duty is fixed, the reactivation temperature will be lower, and could affect the performance. The same applies if the process air is being pre-cooled, say to 100C sat, the same figure should be used for reactivation, as this may occur at the same time, and the same comments apply, with the performance being affected.These are not major issues normally, but if applying to an air-stream that is to achieve a specific moisture content dew-point, then this will be relevant and should be checked.PreservationApplications described as preservation are normally considered to be controlling a space or environment at an RH value at the prevailing temperature.

 be relevant and should be checked.PreservationApplications described as preservation are normally considered to be controlling a space or environment at an RH value at the prevailing temperature. Usually there is no temperature control and the temperature will tend to follow the ambient, but the RH value will be controlled, so no fixed moisture content would be appropriate. As the temperature changes, the RH has to be controlled at whatever temperature occurs. This is likely to be higher during the day, and lower at night.It would be normal, say, to design for 50%rh, at perhaps 100C, with an ambient of 100C sat.However, the ambient average condition throughout the year in the UK is 100C 80%rh, which is 6.7g/kg.

If this is acceptable, then you could refer to the Munters PsyCalc 98 program, which specifies ASHRAE OSA Data (this may need updating.)This programme gives weather data for cities throughout the world, and give 3 options, 0.4%, 1.0% and 2% of the time excursion, beyond the design figures show.

COMPETITIONRefrigeration and cooling methods are perhaps the biggest potential competitor to Munters, as this method is inherently a dehumidifying process. However, most applications are for comfort conditioning, and do not fall within the realm of requiring a desiccant approach, as the balance between latent and sensible cooling achieved by the cooling cycle is adequate to give acceptable humidity levels without the normal need for excessive re-heat.That is not to say that we should ignore cooling as a competitor.

e cooling achieved by the cooling cycle is adequate to give acceptable humidity levels without the normal need for excessive re-heat.That is not to say that we should ignore cooling as a competitor. On the contrary, it is a large industry, and we know that there are many instances where cooling systems are engineered to cope with low dew-point levels, where the sensible approach would be to use a desiccant system for dehumidification, and cooling for separate temperature control.In addition to rotor based technology, another technology producing a different type of dehumidifier exists, which uses a sprayed desiccant liquid to dry the air.

Dehumidification-Munters(Desiccant) v CoolingDehumidification is defined as the removal of water vapour from a gas.In most cases, the gas in question is air, but the same principles apply to most gases, although care should be taken when handling others, which may be toxic or inflammable.Humidity is the term given to the moisture content of a gas (air) and can be expressed as Specific Humidity or Relative Humidity.Specific Humidity, or Absolute Humidity as it is sometimes called, is the mass of water contained in a mass of gas and is expressed as a proportion.Typically, air contains approximately 66% Nitrogen, 23% Oxygen, and 1% others including water vapour. At mid summer, 13g/kg represents 1.

 contained in a mass of gas and is expressed as a proportion.Typically, air contains approximately 66% Nitrogen, 23% Oxygen, and 1% others including water vapour. At mid summer, 13g/kg represents 1.3% of the mass of air at atmospheric pressure (1013mbar)At atmospheric pressure, the Psychrometric chart is a visual, graphic representation of the properties of air, and is invaluable to check influence of changes. Any 2 properties will allow all other properties to be determined from the chart (or you could use DryCap!)There are essentially 3 methods of dehumidification:Cooling to condense moistureIncrease air total pressure (compression) –which forms condensationEmploying a desiccant which allows absorption/adsorbtion by creating differing     vapour pressures.

The air is passed over the evaporator (cooling coil) where it is cooled, and moisture condenses on the cold surfaces, where dehumidification occurs.

 rejecting heat from a compressed and expanded gas. The air is passed over the evaporator (cooling coil) where it is cooled, and moisture condenses on the cold surfaces, where dehumidification occurs. Indirect systems using water/glycol can also be used.Usually, the humidity control is achieved by means of a humidistat or similar device, to keep the cooling going, until the required level is achieved. However, this would normally produce over cooling for the temperature control in the space or air-stream, and re-heat is required to achieve acceptable levels.This type of system can be very efficient at high moisture content levels, and indeed is used as pre-conditioning to desiccant systems, but cannot dehumidify below freezing due to ice formation and the need for de-frost/dual cooling

This means that the temperature will be higher than the inlet, due to the conversion of the latent heat of the moisture condensed, and also the heat from motors.These units are offered for storage type applications, but due to the limitations previously stated are not best suited for unheated areas, as in winter, they are virtually ineffective as a dehumidifier, and act mostly as a

(These figures vary for various special arrangements and applications. Continuous rotation of the rotor (typically 8-10 revs/hour) provides continuous drying performance.The process air in a single pass can be dried by over 6g/kg. If the air is wet enough, and can be capable of achieving very low dew-points below freezing and even down to –600C dew-point. The process can employ other energies than electricity for reactivation, such as steam, hot water, gas and thermal fluid.The key factors of this system are:High moisture depression achievable.

However, in practice, the situation would be worse, as the coil would actually freeze up.

, the cooling is always needed regardless of the space heat loads, to achieve dew-point, and therefore reheat also has to be applies to compensate for the overcooling effect of the dehumidifying coil.The lower operating temperature of the glycol D/H system reduces the refrigeration plant efficiency (glycol mix about –1/-20C flow temperature for the fresh air example) requiring considerably more kW power per kW cooling than 50 and is limited in practical operation to the glycol temperature. (likely to causing frost on the coils). Cooling plant in these circumstances can never produce effective lower moisture content, whereas the Munters D/H can, if required, and on a lower load condition, achieve lower RH values for the space.

Generally the requirements will fall into 2 broad categories, Preservation or Process.Depending on the actual situation, this can be a simple or a more complex procedure.Preservation Preservation projects, as the name suggests, are usually preserving materials or objects to prevent changes in state and maintaining their quality by producing a constant humidity level, and include storage. The definition generally excludes situations where materials are being manufactured.The common requirements for dehumidification are to control and prevent such things as rotting, fungus, condensation, corrosion and absorption of moisture by various hygroscopic materials.

The following are the comparative factors to show that in most cases, certainly for areas that need no temperature control, Munters Desiccant dehumidification is the best option. 1. Disadvantages of Heating, Apart from being costly, it is harder to control. As warm air is lighter than cool air, the warm air will rise within the building leading to heat dissipation through the roof.  The “U” values of the building are such that the thermal heat transfer coefficient can be high.

than cool air, the warm air will rise within the building leading to heat dissipation through the roof.  The “U” values of the building are such that the thermal heat transfer coefficient can be high.  A powerful heating system would have to be installed to cope with the demand arising from the ever changing ambient conditions all year round.High humidity levels in the summer months would create the need for increased heating in order to raise the internal temperature well above ambient to reduce the RH to an acceptable level.  This will significantly increase running costs, and give rise to uncomfortable working conditions for the staff. Maintenance for heating systems must be considered as an ongoing cost.

Maintenance for heating systems must be considered as an ongoing cost.The moisture content and dew-point (condensation level) of the air remain unchanged and are not measured when the air is heated.2. Disadvantages of Refrigerant Dehumidification, In this process the moist air is drawn across a cooling element, where air condenses to water and is drained away. By the laws of physics, refrigeration can only effectively operate down to around 6(c at which time the coiling coil begins to ice up and the unit has to operate in a defrost cycle making it difficult to maintain a low relative humidity at lower temperatures.

A regular maintenance procedure must be laid down with a replacement life of approximately 7 years. Operation is by electrical power only, an expensive energy source. The optimum performance band for this type of equipment to operate is a high relative humidity at a high temperature (e.g. 30(c, 80% RH). At temperatures between 7(c and 12(c at 30% RH, the moisture removal capacity of refrigeration systems is negligible. Refrigeration systems will almost certainly use CFC’s or their derivatives.3.

Proposed Solution, Desiccant Dehumidification, Desiccants attract moisture from the air by creating an area of low vapour pressure at the surface of the desiccant. The vapour pressure of the air is higher, thus water molecules move from the air to the desiccant and the air is dehumidified. Most solid materials attract moisture, plastics e.g. nylon can absorb moisture up to 6% of their dry weight. However, commercial desiccants designed for water vapour collection can attract from one tenth to 100 times their dry weight in water vapour.

Dehumidification goes to the heart of the problem with precise control.

Dehumidification goes to the heart of the problem with precise control. Therefore dry storage is ideal in these circumstances and has the distinct advantage that at the building does not need to be heated, there is no requirement for an insulated structure, so construction costs can be reduced .  It is normal and most economic, for such systems to operate on the “Closed” principle, that is, by re-circulating all the air. Occasionally there will be an “Open” system, one that operates with fresh air on a total loss basis, but this would normally be where there are volatile liquids/vapours or other materials in the store that would create problems.

In practice, both the RH and the temperature would be controlled separately, so the actual g/kg may vary slightly due to tolerances in control.There are a huge number of different process applications within numerous industries, and possibly the largest is food. Perhaps the second largest is Pharmaceutical, and the following indicate some of the different activities where dehumidification is commonly used.

CondensationCondensation is the formation of water, after a gas containing a given moisture content (dew-point) is placed in contact with a surface cooler than that temperature.Condensation is often confused with mould growth, but they are totally different, and it is simple to get one without the other. Mould growth occurs from about 70%RH, without condensation needing to occur.ProblemTypically condensation occurs when moisture in the form of water vapour is introduced into a room.

Mould growth occurs from about 70%RH, without condensation needing to occur.ProblemTypically condensation occurs when moisture in the form of water vapour is introduced into a room. This is clearly seen when kettles are boiled, and vegetables cooked in a kitchen, and immediately after a shower or bath is run.This is because large amounts of water are evaporated quickly, and the room air cannot hold enough water vapour before exceeding the dew-point temperature of the fabric, and condensation is formed on those surfaces.SolutionSimple solution is to open  a window as soon as possible, and preferably before the moisture has condensed on the surfaces, to ventilate the room with ambient air, until the excess vapour has been removed.

(Swimming pools/spas etc.)Heating is sometimes also applied believing it can resolve the issue, but would use large amounts of energy to deal with the mass, and can make matters worse by allowing more evaporation where this is available.ApplicationCondensation in industry is normally due to changes in weather conditions that affect materials that are at relatively stable temperatures.

This means that with diurnal temperature changes of possibly 150C, it is easy to see dew-point conditions and condensation being achieved in a matter of hours.

This means that with diurnal temperature changes of possibly 150C, it is easy to see dew-point conditions and condensation being achieved in a matter of hours.Another condensation situation occurs within pumping stations, where the water temperature in pipe-work is often lower than the ambient dew-point, especially from spring to autumn. The problem can be deterioration of the components due to free water (condensation), but may be more to do with the high humidity levels creating potential corrosion damage to the electrical components/switchgear etc.Similar problems occur within Sewage treatment works or water treatment plant, exaggerated by the water vapour evaporation.

c conveying and Vehicle dischargingSituationPneumatic conveying is a process employing a fan/blower, either pressure or vacuum, used to transfer dry product-often powders, by air at high velocity.Pressure systems normally involve a blower, which compresses air to 0.5 to 1.0 bar typically, which is blown to the rotary valve at the bottom of the silo.The compressed air activates the rotary valve, and collects the material, in the lean phase, and transfers it through pipes at high velocity to secondary vessels some distance away.ProblemAs the air is compressed, the dew point increases (and the air gets hotter), and as the air cools in transit, the RH increases. With long runs of pipework, the temperature can approach the ambient.

With long runs of pipework, the temperature can approach the ambient. If it cools enough, condensation may occur within the pipe and materials can clog, and in extreme circumstances block the pipe.With hygroscopic products, elevated humidity alone can cause coagulation without condensation. Depending on the product being handled, the moisture content may need to be controlled.SolutionTo avoid condensation and excessive humidity, the conveying air at the inlet of the blower may need to be dehumidified. The degree of drying needed will depend on the needs of the product, and also the pressure developed by the blower.

Product DryingBasic PrinciplesMany materials have excessive amounts of water within them at some stage, and need to have the unwanted proportion removed by drying.If a wet product is placed within a container and sealed, moisture vapour transfer takes place until an equilibrium is reached where the vapour pressures of the material and the air in contact with it are equal. This is known as the Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC).Changes to the temperature and the humidity of the air will alter the rates of moisture transfer and it is these principles which are applied to vary product dr

he Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC).Changes to the temperature and the humidity of the air will alter the rates of moisture transfer and it is these principles which are applied to vary product drying rates.Generally speaking, raising the temperature of a wet material increases its vapour pressure, and increases the rate at which the water content can travel to the surface and be evaporated into the air stream, which is the drying medium.Energy must be applied at a rate equal to the latent heat of evaporation of water (c 2450kJ/kg at 200C) continuously, to maintain the process.In a Heating and Ventilation system, the air is replaced as it absorbs water from the material. The drier the air, the faster will be the evaporation rate.

The drier the air, the faster will be the evaporation rate.The faster the air is passed over the wet piece, the faster the water will evaporate. (assuming the surface is wet!) This is rarely the case, and many factors have to be taken into account.FactorsFactors which influence the rate of drying of a solid include:Temperature of water ( Bound Water )Humidity of air in contact with the surface (Absolute)Moisture diffusion rate of the material to be driedThickness of the materialVelocity of the drying air over surface.

The type of product and the moisture content and water removal rate to be achieved determine the preferred method.Generally speaking, the higher the temperature that can be used, the faster the drying rate will be, but the material itself will determine the temperature that can be accepted. Also, some products are structured to limit migration, that could create a “Case hardening” if heated and dried too rapidly, and actually retard the drying time.

It is noted that these systems operate more effectively in the winter months, than in the summer, and so it is clear that the moisture content of the heated air for drying will influence the efficiency.An answer could be to raise the temperature of the air at the spray head, but this would cause damage to the product so is not viable.

tent of the heated air for drying will influence the efficiency.An answer could be to raise the temperature of the air at the spray head, but this would cause damage to the product so is not viable. By drying the air at the inlet, this replicates a winter condition, allows a greater potential for absorption of moisture in the tower, and will increase the performance overall.ExampleThe following were the results of a process trial conducted with and without a desiccant dehumidifier:Ambient =200C 10g/kg,		Air heated to 1850CResults 					Untreated Air		Dehumidified air	Inlet air:	Temperature			1850C				1850C		Water content		10g/kg			4.0g/kgoutlet air:	Temperature			950C				910C		Water content		43.5g/kg			39g/kg		Water absorption		33.

And this equilibrium condition should be retained for any adjustments.Air off the dehumidifier/to the tower is 34.20C 4g/kg., with an inlet of 200C 10g/kg. From this example it is possible to keep a lower temperature of the outlet air with dehumidified air, which reduces the risk of the product sticking in the tower, and at the same time giving an increase of drying capacity of 4.5%.Drier air also makes it possible to increase the capacity if the inlet temperature is increased.

At an inlet temperature of 201.50C the same initial conditions as for untreated air will be obtained, and the water absorption is then 39.5g/kg, which means a capacity increase of 18%.Energy considerationsBy reference to Psychrometric data, X The heat required to remove each kg of water in the tower can be reduced by using dehumidified air. Without dehumidification, the heat in the example would be:(185-20) x 0.24		=	1.37kWh/kg water39.5 x 10-3 x 0.

An ideal process will give:(201.5-34.2) x 0.24	=	1.18kWh/kg water39.5 x 10-3 x 0.86This could also be described as follows: The increase in capacity 4.5 x 10-3 kg will be obtained by an increase in heat which is equal to heat of evaporation. The theoretical heat required for the increase will then be o.7kWh/kg.

as follows: The increase in capacity 4.5 x 10-3 kg will be obtained by an increase in heat which is equal to heat of evaporation. The theoretical heat required for the increase will then be o.7kWh/kg.Due to the fact that the heat losses will exist at the dehumidifier, the heat required will be somewhat more. When heat recovery is applied then 0.85kWh/kg water is calculated. This means that the heat required in the real process will be 1.28kWh/kg water, compared with 1.37kWh/kg water without dehumidification.Depending on the specific condition for each case, the energy savings will vary. The lower the temperature of the air to the tower, the more energy will be saved.

The lower the temperature of the air to the tower, the more energy will be saved. That means that by reducing air temperature but keeping air flow constant to the tower, to provide capacity control, then using a dehumidifier will be more beneficial. It is also obvious that in climatic conditions with high moisture content, using a dehumidifier will make the operation more energy efficient.15.

This was then coated in clay and subsequently dried and fired. This melted out the wax and left a cavity into which the molten precious metal was poured to form the object. The shell was then broken to reveal the highly detailed final piece. The loss of the clay and wax was the Investment of the process.SituationThis process is still carried out today to produce replicated pieces of very high specification tolerances and finishes, very difficult shapes, not achiev

owever, it has been considered that the empirical value for a selection for pods/airlocks should be in the order of 10 air changes/hr and this would then calculate to:10 a/c x 10 pods x 3m x 3m x 2.5m			=	2,250m3/hrNote that 10 a/c x 4 pods x 3m x 3m x 2.5m		=	   900m3/hrSo the actual moisture load selection of 1,410m3/hr is somewhere in the middle.It would be prudent therefore to work with the 10 a/c/hr. figure of 2.250m3/hr, as the actual vehicle visits and duration will not be precisely known.Note:This is an estimated approach. This cannot be a precise selection as the duration of vehicle attachment is variable, as are the gaps at the vehicle, and the number of doors in use at any time is variable, so the condition of air cannot be accurately calculated.

tion as the duration of vehicle attachment is variable, as are the gaps at the vehicle, and the number of doors in use at any time is variable, so the condition of air cannot be accurately calculated.What we do know is, that when this approach of pod dehumidification is taken, the moisture loads through the use of the vehicle doors/pods, is dramatically reduced. If a single air-lock is used, then a figure equal to 10 air changes per hour to select the dehumidifier on re-circulation, appears to give a good solution.Cold store with attached loading bay to loading doorsThis is the most common arrangement arrangement, where there is a loading bay between the cold store and the outside.

The loading bay may or may not be cooled, and if it is, it is a means of attempting to reduce the amount of moisture that will migrate to the cold store, and to help hold the product at low temperature.In either event, dehumidifiers are required to avoid the issues listed.The application is for the dehumidifier to operate on a re-circulation basis within the Loading Dock. The inlet air is taken from immediately above each Loading door, dried in the dehumidifier and then delivering the dry air above each Cold Store door.Calculations.

DO NOT install the units above the door, especially when it is an Inside Cold Room installation. Customers push for this because it is "Wasted Space" for them, but this gives an increased risk of getting frost on the intake filter and unit from the opened doors - leading rapidly to icing up problems.2.	DO NOT install the units too close to the doorways (also for the above reasons).3.	DO try to install the units as close to the external wall as possible where the reactivation air inlet and wet air exhaust ductwork is to penetrate.

A large amount of water is evaporated, and as the freezer is at such a low temperature and vapour pressure, this water vapour readily deposits itself on the internals of the cabinet, and the cooling coils. In addition to the water evaporated from the product, additional moisture gets into the cabinet  as a result of the conveyor openings.

The speed of the conveyor belt and the difference in vapour pressure between the cabinet and the room, determines how much.If the product is wrapped, then the only moisture problem is that associated with the moisture through the openings.Issues that are a concern to the operator due to frost formation are:Process must stop when the coils are frozen sufficientlyLoss of freezer temperature,Need to lower the rate of product flow in the chamberReduce downtime due to frost removalHigh energy used for defrostChamber wet after defrostDamage to belts due to ice build upProduct sticking

ConclusionWe can only extend the defrost to 15.6hrs.(in practice, perhaps some of the moisture evaporating from the product will be discharged out of the chamber before it freezes on the internals). However-the ratio of the infiltration to the total load, will determine any defrost extension. Do not promise what cannot be achieved, often, the product load is very high compared to the infiltration load and there fore extension times can be quite short.Note: that we cannot use the dry air to absorb moisture from the space at –360C!Summary of benefitsIncreased production Because the freezer will no longer have to deal with the total moisture load that was in the air, coils will remain dry or take longer to frost up, so ensuring longer production time between defrosts.

So the problem of reduced refrigeration capacity after a few days running will be minimised, resulting in a consistent high quality product, with the correct temperature every day of the year.Less downtime for cleaning Because the inside including the cooling coils will be dry, the time between cleaning periods can be extended, and the time required for cleaning is much less. This is because after defrosts with just the dehumidifier running it will dry the freezer cabinet very quickly enabling the freezing cycle to be started sooner, without the fear of any excess or residual water being

ings around the saddles are dehumidified with small units to provide low humidity of around 25% RH and avoid any possibility of corrosion, regardless of the ambient temperature and weather conditions.As huge masses of concrete are used to produce the anchor blocks and chambers, moisture will be emitted over long periods. Also the mass will mean constant temperatures, which will possibly allow high humidity levels or even condensation if unprotected. It is essential that some method is used to control the environment, and free access allowed to the steel and anchors for inspection.To this end, dehumidification is used, and a UK example is the original Severn Bridge, near Bristol.

Over time, the enclosures became damaged, and allowed leaks, and created maintenance difficulties, so it was decided to remove the plastic enclosures and dehumidify the complete anchor chamber. Munters supplied and installed packaged dehumidifiers complete with condenser packs to control the humidity levels at around 25%RH.

Physical dehumidification avoids this.

This will give the total air ingress.To avoid possible distortion to the sections, some means of air exchange will be provided on the box sections to allow it to “breathe”.Bear in mind the effect of fast temperature changes of the structure, which could show fast slew rate and design accordingly.

With the SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles) standard coming into force in the US in 2004, swiftly followed by EU4 in 2005 for the European market, emissions testing facilities require much greater accuracy and consistency.As well as improving the sensitivity of the testing instruments themselves, it is also necessary to address the test conditions. This is especially true for direct emissions testing where ambient conditions are not as precisely controlled as they are in a conditioned cell.

s, it is also necessary to address the test conditions. This is especially true for direct emissions testing where ambient conditions are not as precisely controlled as they are in a conditioned cell. With direct emissions testing, variable factors such as the relative humidity of the dilution air used to stabilise the air volume can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the testing. And, as finite levels move lower, the acceptable percentage error is also reduced.For these reasons, many engine manufacturers and testing facilitators are now introducing mechanisms for controlling the moisture content of the dilution air, by dehumidifying it to levels as low as –40ºC dew-point (an equivalent of 0.08g/kg), which is almost completely moisture-free.

cing mechanisms for controlling the moisture content of the dilution air, by dehumidifying it to levels as low as –40ºC dew-point (an equivalent of 0.08g/kg), which is almost completely moisture-free. Use of dry air in this way ensures reproducibility, consistent measurability and stable testing at ultra-low ppm.These benefits are achieved in several ways. The greatest impact is a significant reduction in dilution levels – typically from 25:1 for untreated ambient air to 5:1 for dry air. In addition, dry air reduces the conglomeration of soot particles in diesel engines and eliminates condensation problems during bag sampling.Increased accuracy and repeatability also helps to reduce the testing time so that certification is quicker and less costly.

It can even make the difference between the vehicle retaining its ‘new’ status, rather than having to be sold on as a used car once the engine has been run for longer than the permitted time.At Nissan’s testing facility in Sunderland, for example, a Munters’ dehumidification unit supplies 840m3/h of dry air (<1.4g/kg) to emissions analysis equipment. The dehumidification unit uses a desiccant rotor and even in the worst summer evening conditions the air has a moisture content of no more than 1.2g/kg at 43ºC.

ng what control to use with a dehumidifier first determine what is required!  Stating the obvious but often over looked.Before accepting a tolerance appreciate the consequences of the limits implied.Back to basics :The Psychrometric Chart or its equivalent on computer is used every day and hopefully it is fully understood. However when considering how to control to a point or within an envelope on that chart it is worth just reminding ourselves of the basic facts.Humid air can be conceived as a binary gas mixture of dry air and water vapour. If super saturated that mixture will also contain water droplets.Dry air is composed of eleven components; the most important of which are Nitrogen and Oxygen.

s mixture of dry air and water vapour. If super saturated that mixture will also contain water droplets.Dry air is composed of eleven components; the most important of which are Nitrogen and Oxygen. In normal air-conditioning these components are not condensable, that is why dry air is described as a gas.The water, however, which also is in a gaseous physical condition, is condensable and therefore we refer to it as Vapour. Condensation will normally occur if the water vapour pressure is higher than the actual temperature vapour pressure.With the above in mind engineers and scientists have taken the detail to much greater depths and via complicated formula’s have provided us with the Mollier Diagram, IX chart or Psychrometric Chart.

.With the above in mind engineers and scientists have taken the detail to much greater depths and via complicated formula’s have provided us with the Mollier Diagram, IX chart or Psychrometric Chart.Using that detail designers / contractors are accepting a contract to provide a precise condition of  a gas mixture somewhere within the normal limits of that chart. When referring to very dry air or a very small amount of water vapour as a percentage of its saturation point,  we refer to it Relative Humidity, we are expecting instrumentation to be able to measure and define that gas mixture to close limits or to a specified tolerance.Tolerance:( 2.0 % rh is very common.		21 oC 40 % = 6.3 g/kg or + 6.9 oC dew point.			Envelope at ( 2.0 % will mean 38% or 42%					21 oC 38 % = 5.

such temperature and humidity changes.Consider the ability of the equipment, to which control are connected, to respond with more or less performance.The simple tolerance now becomes more difficult.Equipment response is effected by the size of the cooling plant and its ability to reduce or increase output, summer & winter, high load and low load.Introduce a dehumidifier which will have fluctuating outlet condition as its load is controlled and we can now get temperature and humidity both within limits but out of phase such that tolerance is exceeded.  To offer tight control on humidity we need tight control on temperature – never consider one without the other.Control is also a function of airflow ratios to controlled space volume.

s exceeded.  To offer tight control on humidity we need tight control on temperature – never consider one without the other.Control is also a function of airflow ratios to controlled space volume. Dry storage warehouse tend to be large volumes with only small amount of dry air in circuit i.e. low Air Change Rate (ACR). Process applications or low humidity rooms tend to have large volumes of dry air in circuit i.e. high ACR.  We can generalise and say the higher the air change rate the better will be response and closer will be control tolerance conversely the lower the ACR response will not be as good.The size of the installation and the unit specified sometimes dictates the dehumidifier offered and a review of options available on each unit latter in this submission.

Failure to do that could involve long and costly contracts dispute. Also clients loose confidence in the principle and suppliers or system designers. If Munters / designers point out difficulties / consequences at the design and proposal stage clients are usually appreciative of the discussion and it helps to avoid misunderstandings.

However an important consideration is the effect of low winter design  when ambient air is introduced to a system.Typical schematic :For normal operation moisture content at delivery point “G” is always below room set point so as to pick up space loads. In a winter ambient all air is bypassing the rotor “C to D” i.e. no drying.

:For normal operation moisture content at delivery point “G” is always below room set point so as to pick up space loads. In a winter ambient all air is bypassing the rotor “C to D” i.e. no drying.  With the lower than set point ambient air moisture content entering “B” and with reduced or no moisture load the space rh level will fall below that allowed by the tolerance. The system is out of specification and Munters / designer has no solution as installed.The design engineer should challenged the tolerance and client would have to accepted wintertime excursions or would have to fit a humidifier.Similar problem occurs in an minimum heated storage facility .Requirement is to control at a set rh level, with ( 2.0% rh tolerance, at prevailing temperature.

 of 55 oC by modulating reactivation energy and reactivation airflow.By using this method even with a saturated inlet condition you will not deliquesce LiCl but will be able to hold a room condition.If you modulate just reactivation energy it could allow saturated air at process inlet in a winter period when conditioned space is at design level. Saturated inlet low reactivation temperature will wash out LiCl.Speed control process air fan combined with wet air temperature control is a very good and energy efficient method of control for swimming pools and larger dry storage applications. Relative humidity sensor would be connected to the frequency inverter.Suggest it is not a good option for most process and system designs due to variations in the pressures that will occur.

otronic or AbleDew Point – Condensation / Chilled Mirror (Optical dew point hygrometer)Dew point can be measured by cooling a sample of gas until condensation appears, and observing the temperature when this happens.In an optical dew point instrument, the condensation in the form of dew or frost is induced onto a small mirror within the instrument. When moisture forms it is sensed optically by detecting changes in how the mirror reflects or scatters light. Again the change as seen on the mirror is related to a temperature which then provides a signal for control purposes. Optical dew point sensors are classified as the primary standard for humidity measurement and are the best, most expensive and require more / constant attention than others as described.

Editions Of The Dehumidification Handbook
The first edition of The Dehumidification Handbook was published in
1982 by Cargocaire Engineering Corporation, an earlier name for what
is now the Dehumidification Division of Munters Corporation. That first
edition was reprinted seven times between 1982 and 1989. The second
edition was a totally new and greatly expanded book, written in 1989
and reprinted three times between 1989 and 2002. This recomposition
of the second edition was accomplished in 2002 and includes new ty-
pography and approximately 10% revised material.

his handbook explains how and why to dehumidify air. It is
written for the engineer who has a basic understanding of
building heating and cooling systems, or who operates a building
or process which is influenced by atmospheric humidity.
The text assumes the reader is interested in the technology, and has a
need to apply it to gain some economic benefit. The text also assumes
the reader is interested in specific examples as well as the theory of
dehumidification. These assumptions guide the necessary compromises
any book must make between accuracy and clarity, and between
details which illustrate a specific case and those which illustrate
general, abstract principles.
Part of the information collected here comes from other technical
references which deal incidentally with dehumidification in discussions
of related topics.

Part of the information collected here comes from other technical
references which deal incidentally with dehumidification in discussions
of related topics. The American Society of Heating, Air Conditioning
and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE) has provided helpful
information through its Handbook series. In addition, many industries
have provided data which can assist the dehumidification engineer
working in other fields.
The primary information source is the collected experience of hundreds
of engineers who deal with dehumidification and humidity control on a
daily basis. These individuals have been very generous with their time
and hard won understanding of dehumidification technology. Every
day they must balance the opposing pressures of optimum theoretical
system performance against compelling limitations of available
information, time and budget. The system design examples are
fictitious, but every element contained in them has occurred in the
field.
In the last few years, dehumidification technology has emerged from its
industrial heritage to take an expanding role in commercial and
institutional building heating and cooling systems. The entire field is
changing rapidly. It has been a difficult decision to limit the
information here to what is well understood by the contributors and in
widespread use as of the publication date. Many new applications and
new equipment designs will become available in the next few years.

The contributors and the Editor hope the reader will be kind enough to
inform the publisher of his or her own special knowledge and

PSYCHROMETRICS
T
he practice of humidity control assumes a familiarity with the
properties and behavior of moist air. This is the science of
psychrometrics. While it is not necessary to have a deep
understanding of the thermodynamics of moist air, it is useful to
understand the terms used in the trade, and understand why particular
concepts are essential in designing systems.
Psychrometric terms and equations are described in detail in the Hand-
book of Fundamentals published by the American Society of Heating,
Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE).

Psychrometric terms and equations are described in detail in the Hand-
book of Fundamentals published by the American Society of Heating,
Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (ASHRAE). When an
engineer needs to understand all aspects of psychrometrics, the
ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals provides an excellent reference.
This chapter is not concerned with complete precision for all tempera-
tures and pressures of air and water mixtures. We assume the designer
is working at sea level air pressures, and is concerned with air-water
mixtures at temperatures between -20 and +100°F. The information in
the chapter describes the basic terms in a simple way, and shows how
charts and graphs can be used to understand the overall pattern of air-
moisture dynamics.

CHAPTER TWO
Early in the twentieth century, a German engineer named Richard
Mollier invented a graphic method of displaying the properties of vari-
ous mixtures of air and water vapor. This device has different names in
different counties — the i-x diagram, Mollier diagram or psychrometric
chart — but the names all refer to similar technical graphic displays.
At first, the chart can be rather daunting, because it displays so much
information in a small space. However, once the basic information
elements are understood, the chart becomes an essential reference tool
when designing temperature and humidity control systems.

elements are understood, the chart becomes an essential reference tool
when designing temperature and humidity control systems.
This chapter describes each of the properties of moist air in turn, and
then shows how these can be found quickly by using a psychrometric
chart. The chart is useful both for the information it contains, and the
relationships it shows between air at different conditions. It not only
shows the “trees” in the psychrometric jungle, but shows the whole
“forest” as well, allowing an engineer to gain a sense of how easy or
difficult it might be to change the air from one condition to another.
FIGURE 2.1
The Mollier diagram, often called a
psychrometric chart, provides a compre-
hensive overview of the thermodynamic
properties of air-water mixtures.  If any two
properties of the air mixture are known, the
chart allows an engineer to quickly
determine all its other properties.
The relationships shown in the diagram
change with total air pressure. When
working with air at elevations above 2500 ft.
— or with compressed air — the engineer
must consult different charts for accurate
data.

Dry bulb temperature
To help make the abstract properties of air more concrete, we will
imagine a container filled with a pound of air. The air has been taken
from a sea-level building kept at typical comfort conditions — 70 de-
grees Fahrenheit and 50% relative humidity. Knowing these two prop-
erties of the air, we can determine all others by using a psychrometric
chart. But we will begin by defining what we know.
Dry Bulb Temperature Degrees Fahrenheit
The air temperature is 70 degrees. When
people refer to the temperature of the air,
they are commonly referring to its dry bulb
temperature — what can be read from a stan-
dard thermometer that has no water on its
surface. This is also called the “sensible”
temperature of the air — the heat which can
be sensed by a dry thermometer. (The “wet-
bulb” temperature is measured by a wet thermometer, as described
later in this chapter.)
On a psychrometric chart, the dry bulb temperature of the air is dis-
played at the bottom, increasing from left to right.
Relative humidity Percent of saturation
In our example, the air is at 50% relative
humidity.

ric chart, the dry bulb temperature of the air is dis-
played at the bottom, increasing from left to right.
Relative humidity Percent of saturation
In our example, the air is at 50% relative
humidity. Essentially, relative humidity ex-
presses the moisture content of air as a per-
cent of what it can hold when the air is
saturated.
1 Like the name suggests, it is not a
measure of the absolute amount of moisture
in the air; it measures the moisture contained
in the air relative to the maximum value at
the dry bulb temperature of the air sample. Since that maximum in-
creases with temperature, the term relative humidity has caused much
confusion. When people refer to relative humidity, it is important to
define the dry bulb temperature of the air they are referring to.
Relative humidity
50%
50 % rh
1 This definition is accurate in concept, but strictly speaking, relative humidity is
the ratio of the mole fraction of water vapor to the mole fraction of water vapor
of air saturated at the same temperature and barometric pressure.The difference
between this definition and the description above is normally significant only
outside of the human comfort range.

This is not to say that relative humidity is not useful. Quite the con-
trary. Most materials absorb moisture in proportion to the relative hu-
midity of the surrounding air.

CHAPTER TWO
This is not to say that relative humidity is not useful. Quite the con-
trary. Most materials absorb moisture in proportion to the relative hu-
midity of the surrounding air. Appropriately, many humidity control
systems respond to sensors which measure relative rather than abso-
lute humidity. However, in designing a system to control air moisture, it
is important to define both the relative humidity and its concurrent dry
bulb temperature range.
On the psychrometric chart, relative humidity is displayed as a series of
curves, increasing from the bottom of the chart to the “saturation
curve” which forms the left boundary. The saturation curve represents
100% relative humidity.
Humidity Ratio Grains of water vapor per pound of air
To define the absolute amount of
moisture in the air, we use its weight
compared to the weight of the air.
This is like counting the water mol-
ecules and adding their weight to-
gether. The weight is measured in
grains, and there are 7000 grains in a
pound. In our example, when the air
is at 70°F and 50% rh, its specific
humidity is 55 grains of water per
pound of dry air. In other words, in our one pound sample, 55 grains of
the total weight is water vapor, and 6945 grains is the weight of the air.
The psychrometric chart allows us to determine the humidity ratio of
our air sample.

s, in our one pound sample, 55 grains of
the total weight is water vapor, and 6945 grains is the weight of the air.
The psychrometric chart allows us to determine the humidity ratio of
our air sample. By starting at the 70°, 50% point on the chart, we can
read the humidity ratio by tracing a horizontal line to the chart’s right
edge, where the scale indicates the weight of the moisture in grains per
pound.

2 Actually, the psychrometric chart displays grains of water per pound of dry air
— a slightly different case, since the chart refers to any sample, unbounded by
total weight. Our sample has a fixed total weight. It weighs one pound, 55 grains
of which is water vapor.
FIGURE 2.7FIGURE 2.6
17
PSYCHROMETRICS
Other psychrometric charts will display the humidity ratio as a small
decimal fraction representing the mass of water divided by the mass of
air. It amounts to the same thing. If you multiply the decimal fraction
by 7000, you can convert the ratio to grains of water per pound of air,
since there are 7000 grains in a pound. Multiply the ratio by 1000, and
the value is expressed in grams per kilogram. In all cases, the vertical
scale at the right edge of the chart indicates the absolute rather than
the relative amount of moisture.
Vapor pressure Inches of mercury
Like all gas molecules, each water molecule exerts pressure on the
surrounding environment.

e chart indicates the absolute rather than
the relative amount of moisture.
Vapor pressure Inches of mercury
Like all gas molecules, each water molecule exerts pressure on the
surrounding environment. The amount of vapor pressure at a certain
moisture content is the sum of the pressures of all the water molecules.
The unit of measure is inches of
mercury — in other words, how
high the water vapor can lift a
column of mercury due only to its
own pressure. In this example, the
vapor lifts a column of mercury
0.37 inches high.
In conventional heating and cooling, engineers often measure air pres-
sure in inches of water. Realizing that mercury weighs 13.6 times as
much as water, it becomes apparent that a large amount of water vapor
exerts a considerable force. The pressure difference is enough to peel
paint off of wooden siding in the winter. There is more moisture inside
the wood than outside, so the pressure difference forces the paint off
the surface. As explained further in Chapter 3, desiccant dehumidifiers
use differences in vapor pressure to attract water molecules out of the
air and onto the desiccant surface.
The vapor pressure scale to the right of the chart increases linearly, just
like specific humidity. Humidity ratio essentially represents the number
of molecules, and vapor pressure sums the pressure they exert.

If moist air is cooled, it cannot hold the same amount of moisture. At
some point, the moisture will condense out of the air onto any nearby
surface. This point depends on the amount of moisture in the air, and
is called the dew point temperature. The higher the amount of moisture
in the air, the higher the dew point temperature.
In our example, the air has a moisture con-
tent of 55 grains. This amount of moisture
will condense if the air temperature is
dropped to 50°F. For instance, if a cold can of
beer is taken from the refrigerator at a tem-
perature of 50°F and placed in our air
sample, the can surface will cool the air from
70° to 50°, and moisture in the air next to the
can will begin to condense.
In other words, our air sample is “saturated” when cooled to 50°F — it
has reached a condition of 100% relative humidity.
The left edge of the psychrometric chart is sometimes called the satura-
tion curve. If you draw a line horizontally to the left from the 70°, 50%
rh condition, it will intersect the edge — the saturation curve — at a
temperature of 50°. This particular chart also repeats the dewpoint on
a vertical bar to the right of the chart.

Cooling-based dehumidification systems remove moisture from air by
cooling it below its dewpoint temperature. Cold objects in storage can
be below the dewpoint temperature of the surrounding air, so moisture
condenses on them just like the beer can in our example. The impor-
tance of these facts will become apparent in later chapters.
Enthalpy Btu’s per pound of air
Enthalpy is a useful, but some-
times confusing concept — the
measure of the total energy in the
air. When air is hot, its enthalpy
is high. Enthalpy is also high
when air is moist. This is because
it takes heat to evaporate mois-
ture into the air — the more moisture in the air, the more heat was
70° F = 16.8 Btu
55 grains = 8.6 Btu
Enthalpy = 25.4 Btu

necessary to heat it and evaporate it. Every pound of water requires
approximately 1061 Btu’s for evaporation. (The actual amount of heat
necessary reduces as the temperature rises. 1061 Btus is the value at
0°F). Therefore enthalpy — the total energy of the air — is a function
of its sensible temperature, the absolute amount of moisture it contains
and its total pressure.

of its sensible temperature, the absolute amount of moisture it contains
and its total pressure.
In other references, enthalpy is defined as the sum of the sensible and
latent heat in the air. The term “latent heat” is another way of express-
ing the amount of moisture in the air. Moisture represents the amount
of heat required for its evaporation, but that heat is latent — it cannot
be “sensed” by a dry bulb thermometer. On the psychrometric chart,
the enthalpy scale is located to the left of the saturation curve. In our
example, the enthalpy at 70°F and 50% rh is 25.4 Btu per pound of air.
The concept of enthalpy and the psychrometric chart allows the engi-
neer to quickly and easily calculate the minimum energy to move from
any condition to any other condition. This is very useful in designing
systems to control air temperature and moisture. For example, If we
needed to saturate the air in our container to a condition of 70° and
100% relative humidity, we would have to add moisture, and the en-
ergy required to evaporate the additional moisture would be at least
8.67 Btu’s for every pound of air we saturate. This is the difference
between the current enthalpy and the 34.07 Btu enthalpy of air at 70°,
100% rh.

Wet-bulb temperature Degrees fahrenheit
Where the dry-bulb temperature is mea-
sured by a dry thermometer, the wet-bulb
temperature is taken by surrounding the
sensor with a wet wick and measuring the
reading as the water evaporates. As the
water evaporates from the wick, it draws
heat required for evaporation from the
thermometer bulb, cooling the thermom-
eter in proportion to the amount of evaporation. In our example, the
wet bulb thermometer is cooled from 70°F to 58.5° by evaporation.
If the air was more saturated than 50%, it would not have been cooled
so much. If the air was drier, the wet bulb temperature would be below
58.5°.

On the psychrometric chart, the wet bulb lines are very nearly parallel
to the enthalpy lines. If we know both the wet bulb and dry bulb tem-
perature of the air, its absolute moisture content can be found easily by
using the chart. This is the basis of many simple moisture measure-
ment devices like the “sling psychrometer” .
The concept of wet bulb temperature is useful because it is a relatively
simple and inexpensive way to measure air moisture.

bulb low, the air can absorb a large amount of moisture, and it con-
tains enough sensible heat to vaporize the water it can absorb. If both
the dry and wet bulb temperatures are the same, the air is saturated
and cannot absorb more moisture.

PSYCHROMETRICS
Additional references
There are subtle differences between the definitions we have used here
and definitions which are completely precise for all temperatures and
pressures. For instance, the relative humidity of the air is actually “the
ratio of the mole fraction of water of the sample compared to the mole
fraction of air saturated at the same temperature and pressure”. In most
situations, the difference between this value and the value arrived at by
dividing the sample moisture in grains by the saturated moisture is
insignificant. But in calculations for very low humidities, or for product
drying at high temperatures and high moisture contents, the error is
larger and may be important. When engineers need to know the precise
definition of psychrometric terms, they should consult references that
treat the subject in more depth than space allows here.

Mechanical cooling system
Refrigeration systems transfer heat from
one airstream to another very efficiently —
cooling one and heating the other. This is
the basis for most cooling-based
dehumidification systems.
Cooling-based Dehumidification
Most people are familiar with the principle of condensation. When air
is chilled below its dewpoint temperature, moisture condenses on the
nearest surface. The air has been dehumidified by the process of cool-
ing and condensation. The amount of moisture removed depends on
how cold the air can be chilled — the lower the temperature, the drier
the air.
This is the operating principle behind most commercial and residential
air conditioning systems. A refrigeration system cools air, drains away
some of its moisture as condensate and sends the cooler, drier air back
to the space.

Heat is removed from the dehumidified air by first transferring its ther-
mal energy to an expanding gas — a refrigerant — which is inside the
cooling coil that chilled the air. This coil is called the evaporator, be-
cause inside the coil, the refrigerant is evaporating and expanding from
a liquid to a gas. For that gas to expand inside the coil, it needs heat,
which it gets by cooling the air passing through the coil.
From the cooling coil, the refrigerant gas is sent to a compressor, where
its pressure is increased substantially — 5 to 10 times greater than
when it left the evaporator coil. The gas is therefore a much smaller
volume, but compression has raised its temperature.

the other side of the evaporator coil, but after compression, the refrig-
erant gas may be 200°F or higher. That heat — and the heat from the
process of compression itself — must now be removed from the refrig-
erant. This is accomplished by running the gas through a second coil.
This coil — called the condenser — is located outside the conditioned
space, in a place where the heat can be rejected to the air without
causing problems. These units are often located outside a building or
on a rooftop. The compressed, hot refrigerant condenses back to a liq-
uid inside the coil, and its heat — which started out in the air being
dehumidified — is transferred to the air on the other side of the con-
denser coil. The cooled refrigerant liquid can now return to the coil
cooling the original airstream. As the liquid expands again back to a
gas inside the evaporator coil, it gathers more heat from that airstream
and the cycle repeats.
The process can be very efficient.

and the cycle repeats.
The process can be very efficient. The common measure of efficiency is
the coefficient of performance, which is the energy removed from the
dehumidified airstream divided by the energy invested to accomplish
the transfer to the condenser airstream. This transfer energy consists of
the compressor energy plus the fan energy that pushes air through the
two coils. Many electrically-driven refrigeration systems enjoy coeffi-
cients of performance of 2.0 to 4.5, which is to say the system moves
two to four and a half times as much thermal energy as it consumes in
electrical energy — a very favorable ratio.
Dehumidification through air cooling can be illustrated on a psychro-
metric chart, using air at the same condition we used for the example
in Chapter Two — 70°F and 50% relative humidity.
As air is cooled from 70°F to 51°, no moisture is removed. But when
the air is at 51°, it is saturated — 100% relative humidity — and if it is
cooled further, its moisture will have to condense out of the air. If we
cool the air from 51° to 45°, we will remove 11 grains of moisture
through condensation — the air has been dehumidified.
The actual hardware that accomplishes cooling dehumidification is
exceptionally diverse.

Chilled liquid cooling system
Evaporating refrigerant can cool liquid
rather than air. The liquid is then used to
cool air. The design can cool air close to
32°F without freezing the condensate, and
has the advantage of equalizing the load on
the compressor and condenser when many
different air streams must be cooled by a
single refrigeration system.
Direct expansion systems use the system configuration outlined in the
previous example. The refrigerant gas expands directly into the air cool-

brine chiller systems, according to the fluid cooled by the refrigerant
gas. This is the same basic configuration that operates the water cool-
ers that are so common in commercial and institutional buildings. Al-
though there are hundreds of thousands of small chiller systems like
water coolers, in air conditioning applications, these tend to be more
complex and expensive than alternatives. As a result, chilled liquid
systems are more often used in large installations where they can gain
advantages of installed cost and operating efficiency over DX systems.

Dehumidification-reheat systems can use either direct expansion or
chilled liquid for cooling the air, but following cooling, the air is re-
heated before it is returned to the space. Most residential dehumidifiers
use this configuration. They are sold in appliance stores for use in
basements and moist houses. Commercial and industrial versions of
the dehumidification-reheat system are used in swimming pools, lum-
ber kilns and locker rooms — high temperature, high moisture
environments.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
Dehumidification-reheat systems can use the fundamental operating
characteristics of cooling systems to achieve great efficiency. If all other
variables are constant, the mechanical cooling process is more efficient
when:
• The condenser air temperature is low.
• The cooling coil air temperature is high.
A typical configuration of a dehumidification-reheat system places the
refrigerant condenser coil immediately downstream of the cooling coil.
This is ideal since the low air temperature after the cooling coil makes
the refrigerant condenser very efficient. The reheat energy is essentially
free, since it is heat rejected by the process of cooling. Expensive extra
energy from outside the process is minimized.

free, since it is heat rejected by the process of cooling. Expensive extra
energy from outside the process is minimized.
When the entering air is both warm and very moist, and the required
leaving air dewpoint is also high, dehumidification-reheat systems are
efficient and cost-effective methods of removing moisture from air. The
designer is well-advised to use this method where possible. However,
some limitations of the technology appear when the cooling process
freezes moisture in the air rather than simply condensing it to a liquid.
Frozen condensate causes two problems for a cooling system. First, the
frost insulates the refrigerant from the air passing through the coil,
which reduces heat transfer. Secondly, the frost physically clogs the
coil, reducing the airflow. Eventually the frost blocks the airflow all
together and dehumidification ceases. Systems that cool air below 32°F
include defrost systems to melt the frozen condensate from the coil.
Dehumidification and cooling stops while the coil defrosts.
Specially designed DX dehumidification systems cool air to levels be-
tween 43 and 45°F. Below that point, frost begins to form on parts of
the coil, spreading slowly through the coil as the airflow becomes re-
stricted. Some design techniques can also extend cooling below 43°F
without frost, but the system can become very difficult to control at
part-load conditions.

ough the coil as the airflow becomes re-
stricted. Some design techniques can also extend cooling below 43°F
without frost, but the system can become very difficult to control at
part-load conditions. The difficulty stems from the tendency of the
system to continue cooling the air by a fixed amount. For instance, air
entering at 75°F might be cooled to 55° — a 20° temperature differen-
tial. But if the system is not carefully controlled, part of the air entering
at 50°F will be cooled to 30°, which freezes condensate in the coil.
Chilled liquid dehumidification systems are easier to control at low
temperatures than DX cooling systems, because there is a smaller dif-
ference between the fluid entering and leaving the cooling coil. For
example, the chiller may supply 32°F liquid to the air cooling coil,
FIGURE 3.5
Dehumidification-reheat system
Most small, residential dehumidifiers use the
cooling-reheat schematic to remove
moisture from air. For high temperatures
and moisture levels, the arrangement is
especially efficient because it places the
refrigerant condenser down stream of the
evaporator. The reheat energy is essentially
free, and the condensor is most efficient in
the low temperature air that comes from
the evaporator coil.

might have to create a temperature of 20°F as the refrigerant expands
into the coil in order to achieve that same 35°F average leaving air
condition. This means part of the coil surface will be below 32°F, and
frost will form at that point.
The specific dehumidification capacities of cooling systems are highly
dependent on hardware specifics, and generalizations can be mislead-
ing. It is enough for the engineer to realize that while cooling systems
dehumidify efficiently at high temperatures, special precautions are
necessary when using cooling systems to dry air below a 40°F
dewpoint.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
Desiccant Dehumidifiers
Desiccant dehumidifiers are quite different from cooling-based dehu-
midifiers. Instead of cooling the air to condense its moisture, desiccants
attract moisture from the air by creating an area of low vapor pressure
at the surface of the desiccant. The pressure exerted by the water in the
air is higher, so the water molecules move from the air to the desiccant
and the air is dehumidified.
Actually, most solid materials can attract moisture. For instance, plas-
tics like nylon can absorb up to 6% of their dry weight in water vapor.

Actually, most solid materials can attract moisture. For instance, plas-
tics like nylon can absorb up to 6% of their dry weight in water vapor.
Gypsum building board can also store a great deal of water vapor, and
the oxide layer on metals attracts and holds a small amount of water
vapor under the right conditions. The difference between these materi-
als and commercial desiccants is capacity. Desiccants designed for
water vapor collection attract and hold from 10 to over 10,000 percent
of their dry weight in water vapor, where other materials have much
lower moisture capacity.
The essential characteristic of desiccants is their low surface vapor
pressure. If the desiccant is cool and dry, its surface vapor pressure is
low, and it can attract moisture from the air, which has a high vapor
pressure when it is moist. After the desiccant becomes wet and hot, its
surface vapor pressure is high, and it will give off water vapor to the
surrounding air. Vapor moves from the air to the desiccant and back
again depending on vapor pressure differences.
Desiccant dehumidifiers make use of changing vapor pressures to dry
air continuously in a repeating cycle described by the simplified equi-
librium diagram at left. The desiccant begins the cycle at point one. Its
surface vapor pressure is low because it is dry and cool.

librium diagram at left. The desiccant begins the cycle at point one. Its
surface vapor pressure is low because it is dry and cool. As the desic-
cant picks up moisture from the surrounding air, the desiccant surface
changes to the condition described by point two. Its vapor pressure is
now equal to that of the surrounding air because the desiccant is moist
and warm. At point two, the desiccant cannot collect more moisture
because there is no pressure difference between the surface and the
vapor in the air.
Then the desiccant is taken out of the moist air, heated, and placed into
a different airstream. The desiccant surface vapor pressure is now very
high — higher than the surrounding air — so moisture moves off the
surface to the air to equalize the pressure differential. At point three,
the desiccant is dry, but since it is hot, its vapor pressure is still too
high to collect moisture from the air. To restore its low vapor pressure,
the desiccant is cooled — returning it to point one in the diagram and
completing the cycle so it can collect moisture once again.

CHAPTER THREE
Thermal energy drives the cycle. The desiccant is heated to drive mois-
ture off its surface (point two to point three). Then the desiccant is
cooled to restore low vapor pressure (point three to point one). The
efficiency of the process improves when the desiccant has a high mois-
ture capacity and a low mass. The ideal desiccant dehumidifier would
have an infinitely high surface area for collecting moisture, and an
infinitely low mass, since the required heating and cooling energy is
directly proportional to the mass of the desiccant and the mass of the
machinery which presents the desiccant to the airstream. The heavier
the desiccant assembly compared to its capacity, the more energy it
will take to change its temperature — which accomplishes dehumidifi-
cation.
Desiccants can be either solids or liquids — both can collect moisture.
For example, the small packets inside camera cases and consumer elec-
tronics boxes often contain silica gel, a solid desiccant. Also, triethy-
lene glycol — a liquid similar to auto antifreeze — is a powerful
desiccant which can absorb moisture.

ases and consumer elec-
tronics boxes often contain silica gel, a solid desiccant. Also, triethy-
lene glycol — a liquid similar to auto antifreeze — is a powerful
desiccant which can absorb moisture. Liquid and solid desiccants both
behave the same way — their surface vapor pressure is a function of
their temperature and moisture content.
One subtle distinction between desiccants is their reaction to moisture.
Some simply collect it like a sponge collects water — the water is held
on the surface of the material and in the narrow passages through the
sponge. These desiccants are called adsorbents, and are mostly solid
materials. Silica gel is an example of a solid adsorbent. Other desic-
cants undergo a chemical or physical change as they collect moisture.
These are called absorbents, and are usually liquids, or solids which
become liquid as they absorb moisture. Lithium chloride is a hygro-
scopic salt which collects water vapor by absorption, sodium chloride
— common table salt — is another.
Whether the desiccant functions by absorption or adsorption is not
usually important to a system designer, but the distinction exists and
engineers should be aware of the difference between the two terms.
So far we have discussed how the desiccant functions. Now we will
examine what happens to the air being dehumidified. When moisture
is removed from air, the reaction liberates heat. This is simply the re-
verse of evaporation, when heat is consumed by the reaction.

Dehumidified air path
As moisture is removed from the air, its
enthalpy stays constant, so its sensible
temperature rises. In fact, the enthalpy of
the process air —  air being dehumidified —
actually increases slightly. This is because in
many dehumidifiers, a small amount of
residual heat from desiccant reactivation can
be carried into the dry air stream.

leaves the dehumidifier warmer than when it entered the desiccant
unit.
The temperature rise is directly proportional to the amount of moisture
removed from the air — the drier the air leaves the dehumidifier, the
warmer it will be.
Looking at the process on a psychrometric chart, it is apparent how
desiccant dehumidification differs from cooling-based dehumidifica-
tion.

Looking at the process on a psychrometric chart, it is apparent how
desiccant dehumidification differs from cooling-based dehumidifica-
tion. Using our previous example of air entering the dehumidifier at
70°F and 50% relative humidity, the dry bulb temperature rises as the
moisture falls, so that the total energy (enthalpy) of the air stays the
same. In fact, the total energy actually increases slightly because of
waste heat transferred to the air from the regeneration process. In
many applications — notably product drying and unheated storage —
this temperature rise of the dry air is desirable. In other cases addi-
tional sensible heat is not an advantage, so the dry air is cooled before
being delivered to the point of use.
There are five typical equipment configurations for desiccant
dehumidifiers:
• Liquid spray-tower
• Solid packed tower
• Rotating horizontal bed
• Multiple vertical bed
• Rotating Honeycombe®
Each configuration has advantages and disadvantages, but all types of
desiccant dehumidifiers have been widely applied.

CHAPTER THREE
Liquid spray-tower
Spray-tower dehumidifiers function much like an air washer, except
instead of water, the units spray liquid desiccant into the air being
dried, which is called the process air. The desiccant absorbs moisture
from the air and falls to a sump.

and continues to absorb moisture until a level control indicates it
should be dried out and reconcentrated. Then part of the solution is
drained off and circulated through a heater. The warm desiccant is
sprayed into a second airstream, called the reactivation air. Moisture
leaves the desiccant and moves to the air.

The numbers on the diagram show how the hardware uses desiccant
equilibrium characteristics to remove water first from the process air,
and then from the desiccant. In the conditioner, the desiccant is ab-
sorbing water, becoming warmer and rising in vapor pressure—moving
from point 1 to point 2 on the equilibrium chart. The desiccant in the
sump is at point 2 in the chart — the desiccant solution has absorbed a
great deal of water, and its surface vapor pressure is too high to attract
more vapor. As the diluted desiccant passes through the heater, its
vapor pressure rises, and when it is sprayed into the reactivation air the
high pressure forces the water out of the desiccant and into the air.
This corresponds to moving between point 2 and point 3 on the equi-
librium chart.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
As the desiccant returns from the regenerator to the sump, it is dry —
concentrated — but still has a high vapor pressure because it is warm.
To cool the desiccant, part of the liquid is pulled out of the sump and
circulated through a heat exchanger connected to a chilling system or
cooling tower. The desiccant then moves from point 3 to point 1 on the
equilibrium chart. Its vapor pressure is low because it is both dry and
cool, so it can be circulated back through the conditioner to absorb
more moisture.
Liquid spray tower dehumidifiers have some uniquely favorable charac-
teristics.

Liquid spray tower dehumidifiers have some uniquely favorable charac-
teristics. Dehumidification is thermodynamically quite elegant, because
the desiccant is only heated or cooled to the minimum necessary to
accomplish the required dehumidification. Also, when the process re-
quires a constant humidity and the inlet air is dry, water can be added
to the desiccant solution so the conditioner will act as a humidifier
instead of a dehumidifier. Extra liquid can also be regenerated and sent
to a holding tank, providing energy storage in less than 20% of the
floor space of an equivalent ice-storage system. Further, since the liquid
desiccant contacts the air, particles are removed as well as water vapor.
Liquid spray dehumidifiers are frequently arranged in large, central
systems rather than small, free-standing units for small spaces. This is
partly because they tend to be somewhat more complex than solid
desiccant units, but also because large systems can be designed with
several conditioner units connected to a single regenerator. This con-
figuration is similar to a mechanical refrigeration system with multiple
evaporators connected to a single condenser. For large buildings with
several dehumidification systems, this can have advantages of first
cost, at the expense of complexity of controls.

cost, at the expense of complexity of controls.
Potential disadvantages of liquid systems include response time, main-
tenance, and first cost for smaller units. Because the desiccant solution
may be distributed throughout a long piping system and large reserve
sump, the system can take time to respond to fast changing internal
moisture loads or different necessary outlet conditions — such as occur
in environmental simulation chambers. But slow response on the outlet
conditions also means slow response to inlet changes — which can be
an advantage. A large mass of recirculating desiccant protects an inter-
nal process from rapid changes in weather moisture.
Maintenance varies, but some liquid desiccants are corrosive, and
therefore need more attention. Also, at low humidity levels, some liq-
uid desiccants can dry out rapidly, which means liquid levels must be
carefully watched to avoid desiccant solidification.

CHAPTER THREE
Solid packed tower
In the packed tower dehumidifier, solid desiccants like silica gel or
molecular sieve is loaded into a vertical tower. Process air flows
through the tower, giving up its moisture to the dry desiccant.

The thermal energy that drives the desiccant cycle in a solid desiccant
tower is added to the process by heating and cooling the reactivation
and process airstreams. In other words, when the saturated desiccant
must be heated to raise its surface vapor pressure (point 2 to point 3 on
the equilibrium diagram), the heat is carried to the desiccant by hot
reactivation air. Likewise, when the hot dry desiccant must be cooled
to lower its vapor pressure (point 3 to point 1), the cool process air
removes the heat from the bed.
Since drying and reactivation take place in separate, sealed compart-
ments, the packed tower dehumidifier is frequently used to dry pressur-
ized process gases. In fact, the same configuration is used to dry liquid

loaded into the towers, the process can achieve very low dewpoints —
in many cases below -40°F. Desiccant dehumidifiers for compressed air
are frequently the packed-tower type.
While the configuration allows very low dewpoints, the packed tower
design can also result in a changing outlet condition. When the desic-
cant is first exposed to the process airstream, it can dry the air deeply.
Later, as its moisture capacity fills up, the air is not dried quite so
much. If a changing outlet condition would cause problems in a pro-
cess, controls could be provided to ensure the towers are changed be-
fore the process air condition becomes too wet.

As process airflow requirements get larger, packed tower dehumidifiers
get very large because air velocities are generally kept quite low. Low
air velocities are necessary for two reasons. High velocities would lead
to uneven air distribution through the bed because moist air would
“tunnel” through the desiccant. Also, the air velocity must remain low
to avoid lifting the desiccant, which would then impact against other
particles and the walls of the dehumidifier vessel. The impact would
fracture the desiccant, which would blow out of the unit in the form of
a fine dust.
Engineers will notice that these types of units are frequently used in
very small, low-dewpoint air streams and in process gas drying applica-
tions. The configuration offers compensating advantages in those situa-
tions that offset size and energy consumption disadvantages that
appear in large-airflow, higher-dewpoint, atmospheric-pressure
applications.

CHAPTER THREE
Rotating horizontal bed
In this device, dry, granular desiccant is held in a series of shallow,
perforated trays that rotate continuously between the process and reac-
tivation airstreams. As the trays rotate through the process air, the des-
iccant adsorbs moisture.

Like in the packed tower, the process and reactivation air heats and
cools the desiccant to drive the adsorption-desorption cycle. In the
process side, the desiccant starts out dry — having just left the reacti-
vation side. But the desiccant is still warm from the reactivation pro-
cess. The desiccant is cooled by the process air during the first few
degrees of rotation through the process side. This corresponds to the
change from point 3 to point 1 on the equilibrium diagram. Then the
desiccant dries the rest of the process air and picks up moisture —
point 1 to point 2 on the diagram. As the trays rotate into the hot reac-
tivation air, the desiccant is heated and releases moisture — point 2 to
point 3 on the equilibrium diagram.
The design is modular. To increase capacity, the manufacturer can
either increase the diameter of the rotating trays so they will hold more
desiccant, or increase the number of beds stacked on top of one an-
other.

To avoid this leakage, rotating bed designs generally arrange the pro-
cess and reactivation airflow in a parallel rather than a counterflow
configuration. This keeps the pressures more equal between the pro-
cess and reactivation sides of the unit, which reduces leakage and im-
proves performance.

proves performance. The technique still has limitations, and such units
are more sensitive to the moisture condition of the entering reactivation
air than some other designs. Also, the parallel arrangement of process
and reactivation airflows is not as energy efficient as a counterflow
arrangement. As a result, reactivation energy consumption can be very
high for these units compared to other designs.
Against these limitations, the rotating horizontal bed design offers a
low first cost. The design is simple, expandable and easy to produce.
Although the desiccant can fracture and carry over into the airstream, it
can be replaced by disassembling the beds to refill them. In situations
where energy cost is not high, or where it does not represent a great
deal of money in absolute terms — such as in small dehumidifiers —
the low first cost of these units may offset their high operating costs.

Like the packed tower, this design can achieve low dewpoints because
leakage between process and reactivation air circuits is minimized.
Also because the beds are separate and sealed from one another, the
pressure difference between process and reactivation is not so critical,
so airstreams can be arranged in the more efficient counterflow pattern
for better heat and mass transfer. Like the rotating bed, the ratcheting,
semi-continuous reactivation of the desiccant provides a relatively con-
stant outlet air moisture condition on the process side, reducing the
“sawtooth” effect that can occur in packed tower units.
These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased mechanical
complexity. So compared to rotating horizontal bed units, the vertical
bed dehumidifiers tend to be more expensive, and can require more
maintenance. Generally, however, these are minor limitations compared
to the large savings in energy and performance improvements at low
dew points.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
Rotating Honeycombe®
Another dehumidifier design uses a rotating Honeycombe® wheel to
present the desiccant to the process and reactivation airstreams. This is
sometimes called a DEW (DEsiccant Wheel) dehumidifier. The finely
divided desiccant is impregnated into the semi-ceramic structure,
which in appearance resembles corrugated cardboard that has been
rolled up into the shape of a wheel. The wheel rotates slowly between
the process and reactivation airstreams.

ture from the air. As
the desiccant picks up moisture it becomes saturated and its surface
vapor pressure rises, which corresponds to the change between point 1
and point 2 on the equilibrium diagram. Then as the wheel rotates into
the reactivation airstream, the desiccant is heated by the hot reactiva-
tion air, and the surface vapor pressure rises, allowing the desiccant to
release its moisture into the reactivation air. This is the change from
point 2 to point 3 on the equilibrium diagram.
Following reactivation, the hot desiccant rotates back into the process
air, where a small portion of the process air cools the desiccant so it
can collect more moisture from the balance of the process airstream.
This is the cooling described by the change between points 3 and 1 on
the equilibrium diagram.

CHAPTER THREE
The rotating Honeycombe® design has several advantages. The struc-
ture is very lightweight and porous. Different kinds of desiccants —
both solid and liquid — can be loaded into the structure, which allows
a wheel to be tailored for specific applications. Since the flutes of the
structure are like individual, desiccant-lined air ducts, the desiccant
surface area presented to the air is maximized even while the airflow
remains smooth, reducing air pressure resistance compared to packed
beds. Low dewpoints and high capacity — normally two mutually ex-
clusive goals — can be achieved by combining different desiccants in
the same wheel. And since the total rotating mass is low compared to
its moisture removal capacity, the design is quite energy-efficient. The
design is also quite simple, reliable and easy to maintain.
One design concern with Honeycombe® dehumidifiers is the cost of the
rotating wheel. The structure is energy efficient, but costs more to pro-
duce compared to granules of dry desiccant. Care should be taken to
insure the wheel is not damaged. The first cost is apparently balanced
by operational advantages, since the design is the most widely installed
of all desiccant dehumidifier configurations in ambient pressure appli-
cations.

by operational advantages, since the design is the most widely installed
of all desiccant dehumidifier configurations in ambient pressure appli-
cations.
Comparing desiccant dehumidifiers
All desiccant dehumidifiers can be made to work in virtually any appli-
cation suited for desiccant dehumidifiers. The limitations of each con-
figuration can be overcome and benefits of each design optimized by
careful application engineering. No firm statement can be made about
the limits of performance or amount of energy consumed or mechani-
cal reliability of different dehumidifier types outside of a particular set
of installation circumstances. Application engineering rather than the
dehumidifier type makes a dehumidification installation reliable, effi-
cient and low in first cost.
There are, however, some fundamental questions for the engineer to
ask of potential system suppliers. These include:
• Installed cost
The cost of the dehumidifier itself can be a small fraction of the cost of
the installation. Since different configurations vary in their need for
additional equipment, utilities and plant support — like chilled water,
floor space and weather protection — the cost of the dehumidifier itself
is less important than the cost of the complete installation.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
• Operating cost
The installed cost of mechanical systems is often small compared to
their cost of operation and maintenance.

METHODS OF DEHUMIDIFICATION
• Operating cost
The installed cost of mechanical systems is often small compared to
their cost of operation and maintenance. The chief cost of running a
dehumidification system is heat for reactivation and cooling for the
desiccant and process air. When designs take advantage of low-cost
energy sources for these utilities, they can often offset installed cost
differences in a matter of months, yielding enormous financial benefits
over the typical 15 to 30 year life of this equipment.
• Demonstrated operational reliability
Each dehumidifier configuration behaves differently in different appli-
cations. If the installer or supplier can demonstrate an understanding of
equipment behavior in the application in question, potential difficulties
are reduced for the end user. While every installation is different, the
engineer does well to limit the number of “unknowns” for his project.
• Design assumptions
Different engineers and manufacturers necessarily make different as-
sumptions concerning a given application. The selection of equipment
configuration and size is completely dependent upon these assump-
tions. Often reasons for widely varying selections are the result of in-
complete or erroneous data available to the system designer.
Putting the different types of dehumidifiers into perspective is very
difficult, because specific circumstances make it impossible to state
universally accurate comparisons.

Among desiccant types, the liquid spray type is most commonly used

CHAPTER THREE
Choosing between desiccant
and cooling dehumidifiers
In many situations, both desiccants and cooling-based dehumidifiers
can remove moisture from air, so the question arises — which type to
use? Like choosing between different types of desiccant dehumidifiers,
there are no simple answers to this question, but there are some gen-
eral guidelines that have emerged in the industry:
• Cooling and desiccant-based dehumidification systems are most eco-
nomical when used together. The technologies complement each other,
each strength of desiccants covers a weakness of cooling systems and
vice-versa.
• The difference in the cost of electrical power and thermal energy will
determine the optimum mix of desiccant to cooling-based dehumidifica-
tion in a given situation. If thermal energy is cheap and power costs
high, the economics will favor using desiccants to remove the bulk of
the moisture. If power is inexpensive and thermal energy for reactiva-
tion costly, the operating economics will favor using more cooling-
based dehumidification in the project.

 to remove the bulk of
the moisture. If power is inexpensive and thermal energy for reactiva-
tion costly, the operating economics will favor using more cooling-
based dehumidification in the project.
• Cooling-based dehumidification systems are more economical than
desiccants at high air temperatures and moisture levels. They are very
seldom used to dry air below a 40°F dew point because condensate
freezes on the coil, reducing moisture removal capacity.
• Desiccants may have useful advantages when treating ventilation air
for building HV AC systems which use ice storage. Since these systems
deliver air at moderately low dew points (40 to 45°F), dehumidifying
the fresh air with the desiccant system decreases the installed cost of
the cooling system, and eliminates deep coils with high air and liquid-
side pressure drops. This saves considerable fan and pump energy.
• Desiccants are especially efficient when drying air to create low rela-
tive humidities, and cooling-based dehumidification is very efficient
when drying air to saturated air conditions. If the air should be drier
than when it entered the machine, but still close to saturation at a
lower temperature, cooling-based dehumidification would be a good
choice. But if the desired end result is air at a condition far from satura-
tion — low relative humidities — a desiccant unit would be ideal.

The two technologies work most efficiently
when used together, so the advantages of
each compensate for the limitations of the
other.

pplications for desiccant dehumidifiers are exceptionally diverse.
 Such equipment can have a very positive impact:
• Plastic soda bottles can be produced twice as fast when dry air is
supplied to the mold, which means one plant can do the work of two,
saving millions of dollars in new plant construction.
• Desiccant dehumidifiers have allowed Leonardo Da Vinci’s famous
fresco, The Last Supper, to survive urban pollution and floods, preserv-
ing the masterpiece for future generations.
• Suspension bridge cables corrode where they enter the concrete an-
chor blocks. Without dehumidifiers, the main cables would have to be
replaced, costing millions of dollars and stopping traffic on some of the
world’s busiest river crossings.
• Without dehumidifiers, it would be impractical to manufacture the
lithium batteries that power cardiac pacemakers, which keep hundreds
of thousands of people alive and productive.
In this chapter we will discuss the six principal categories of dehumidi-
fication applications, with the purpose of stimulating the thoughts of
creative engineers, and reassuring those who might believe they are
“the first to try” a given application. Removing excess humidity from
the air can have very interesting and profitable consequences.

CHAPTER FOUR
Corrosion Prevention
All materials corrode, which is to say every substance eventually
changes from one form to another through chemical reactions. Many of
these reactions, especially those which depend on oxygen, are cata-
lyzed and accelerated by moisture.
Ferrous metals like iron and steel are well known for their corrosion in
the presence of moisture. Less well known is the fact that glass cor-
rodes and cracks at a rate which varies according to the moisture on its
surface. Pure crystals like sodium iodide and lithium fluoride also cor-
rode, forming oxides and hydroxides in proportion to the moisture in
the air. In the past, tens of thousands of desiccant dehumidifiers have
been used to surround machinery and equipment with dry air, preserv-
ing ferrous metal parts from heavy rust.
In the present, dehumidifiers are working to protect materials from
more subtle and expensive forms of corrosion. Modern society depends
more and more on light equipment like computers, telecommunications
gear, lightweight composite materials and high-energy batteries. While
these are less subject to gross rusting, they are very sensitive to micro-
scopic-level corrosion.

these are less subject to gross rusting, they are very sensitive to micro-

large problems. Desiccant systems save owners literally hundreds of
millions of dollars each year by preventing both gross and microscopic
corrosion.

age for long-term protection of inactive ships, machinery and weapons.
The technique saved millions of dollars in preservation costs.

 1950’s after the Korean War, the U.S. military used dry air stor-
age for long-term protection of inactive ships, machinery and weapons.
The technique saved millions of dollars in preservation costs. In the
1970’s, European military groups, notably those in Sweden and
Denmark, pioneered the use of desiccant equipment for protection of
active duty military material. Now tens of thousands of dehumidifiers
protect expensive military equipment in all parts of the world, cutting
maintenance costs drastically, and increasing the combat readiness of
aircraft, tanks, ships and supplies.
Electronics protection
Computers and other electronic equipment use small voltages and low
currents to perform their functions. When minute layers of corrosion
build up on circuit surfaces, they increase electrical resistance and de-
crease capacitance, which can seriously effect calibration and perfor-
mance. Also, when electrical equipment is rapidly cooled and heated
— such as when cold aircraft descend into warm, humid airports —
there is a potential for condensation and corrosion. Dehumidifiers pre-
vent these problems, saving calibration time and improving the mean
time between failure of electronic systems.
Power plant layup
When power plants are idled for maintenance or because of excess
generator capacity, dehumidifiers are installed to blow dry air through
both the steam side and generator windings.

Power plant layup
When power plants are idled for maintenance or because of excess
generator capacity, dehumidifiers are installed to blow dry air through
both the steam side and generator windings. This costs less and is safer
than blanketing with nitrogen, and is far more effective than either wet
layup with corrosion inhibitors or preservation in grease. Dry air layup
is very simple, and the plant can go back on-line in a matter of hours
rather than weeks.
Lithium battery production
Lithium, plutonium and other high-energy metals are hazardous be-
cause they ignite when atmospheric water vapor makes them corrode.
Dehumidifiers make it possible to work with such metals quite safely in
open air. Desiccant units dry large production rooms with dozens of
people to moisture levels below 1% relative humidity. This has made
the large-scale lithium battery industry economically viable. Without
the desiccant dehumidifier, the lithium battery would still be an expen-
sive, special-purpose curiosity.

CHAPTER FOUR
Condensation Prevention
When cold surfaces are surrounded by moist air, water vapor will con-
dense on the surface like “sweat” on a cold beer glass in summertime.
This can lead to a surprising number of problems. For instance, con-
sumers in a supermarket may not be able to see frozen foods in a re-
frigerated display case with a glass door. That may mean thousands of
dollars in lost revenue.

mber of problems. For instance, con-
sumers in a supermarket may not be able to see frozen foods in a re-
frigerated display case with a glass door. That may mean thousands of
dollars in lost revenue. Alternately, condensation can form on hidden
aircraft structural members as a plane descends from the cold upper
atmosphere into moist environments, which can accelerate stress corro-
sion, shortening the life of the airframe. In both of these cases, dehu-
midifiers are installed to surround the cold surface with dry air.
Often, condensation control creates economic opportunities rather than
simply preventing a problem. For instance, chilled rollers are used in
many production processes to cool thin films or coatings. By blanketing
the roll surface with dry air, the coolant temperature can be much
lower without causing condensation. This means the product can be
cooled faster, perhaps eliminating the need for a second machine.
Typical Applications
• Optical polishing
• Refrigerated display cases
• Environmental simulation
• Large gear cases
• High vacuum sputtering
• Gumball forming rolls
• Chilled rollers for film casting
• Refrigerated warehouse floors
• Altitude simulation cooling
• Cold product receiving rooms
• Typewriter ribbon film coating
• Fruit & vegetable storage
• Rock cave storage

APPLICATIONS
Ice rinks
The ice temperature is cooler than the dewpoint of the surrounding air, so
moisture condenses on the rink surface. The ice will soften and roughen,
and the refrigeration system must work hard to keep the ice suitable for
skating. Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to remove moisture before it
can condense on the ice. Operating costs for the refrigeration system are
reduced by thousands of dollars per year. The dry air also prevents haz-
ardous ice from forming on surfaces around the rink, and eliminates cor-
rosion of structural members. Dehumidifiers allow increased profits in
warm weather; and they improve building safety in cold climates.
Water treatment plants
Ground water and lake temperatures are often much lower than air
dewpoints, which can result in condensation on the outside of the
pipes, valves and controls in the plant. Providing dry air to the plant
prevents the condensation that leads to mold and fungus growth, as
well as rusting the valves and controls. The cost of the dehumidifier is
very modest compared to the cost of painting pipes and periodical re-
placement of controls and valves. Additionally, the sanitary benefits of
eliminating fungus and bacteria have increased in importance as con-
sumers become more sensitive to water quality issues.

Surface preparation & coating
Large, cool metal surfaces like ship interiors and chemical storage tanks
must be periodically re-coated. Coating manufacturers will not guaran-
tee the life of the coating unless the contractor can prove the surface
was clean and dry when the coating was applied. Contractors now use
desiccant dehumidifiers so they can blast and coat regardless of the
weather. Dry air lets them keep a cleaned surface free from condensa-
tion indefinitely, which means they can schedule coating operations
more economically. Dehumidifiers provide better coatings for end users
and lower costs for contractors.
Injection molding
Chilled water is often provided to injection molds so plastic parts can
be cooled rapidly. But if the chilled mold condenses moisture, the plas-
tic surface is damaged, and part strength can suffer through thermal
shock. Dehumidifiers blanket the mold surface with dry air, eliminating
condensation. The coolant temperature can be reduced, which means
the cycle time for each shot is reduced. Since machine time is often the
key cost in highly competitive plastic molding markets, this processing
speed gives manufacturers with dry molds a very important competi-
tive advantage.

CHAPTER FOUR
Mold/Fungus Prevention
Mold and fungus are present in almost all materials. They can survive
without moisture, remaining dormant for decades, even centuries. But
when moisture and a food source become available they will multiply
rapidly. This moisture does not have to be in liquid form. Microscopic
organisms can use moisture present in solid materials because they
need so little.
Two classic examples of this phenomenon are the prehistoric cave
paintings in Lascaux, France, and the Egyptian artifacts preserved in
the pyramids. The cave paintings survived virtually intact for 16,000
years. Then tourists began bringing moisture into the caves in their
clothes and through their respiration. The paintings have deteriorated
through microbiological attack in less than 40 years. Egyptian artifacts
have had the same difficulty, with tragic consequences for history.
Even metals are attacked indirectly by certain bacteria. The U.S. Navy
has traced corrosion in ships bilges to acidic by-products of microbio-
logical metabolism, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in repair
expenses.

APPLICATIONS
Archival storage
Historic documents, photographs and art works are hygroscopic and
often made of organic materials. When they absorb moisture, micro-
organisms multiply and cause damage. Dehumidifiers are used to pro-
vide low relative humidity environments which prevents microbial
attack. The dry air also allows these objects to be stored outside of
temperature-controlled areas which saves money in building and heat-
ing costs. Many palaces in Great Britain and churches in Denmark are
neither heated nor cooled — they are simply dehumidified — providing
great savings in equipment and operational costs.
Seed storage
Organic materials are all subject to microbial attack, but few materials
have the sensitivity of seeds.

Seed storage
Organic materials are all subject to microbial attack, but few materials
have the sensitivity of seeds. They are mechanically quite sturdy, but
when seed moisture content is high, microbes can multiply and destroy
the important nutrients they contain. Dehumidifiers allow preservation
of rare seeds in scientific applications and they preserve seed value in
commercial applications. In developing countries, grain losses in stor-
age can exceed 30% of the crop. By preventing this cause of food short-
ages, dehumidifiers have the same effect as a 30% increase in crop
yield.
Cargo protection
Lubrication oils, leather goods, canned foods, grain and fertilizers suf-
fer from moisture in ocean transit. Bulk cargo like grain, flour, cocoa
beans and tobacco is especially vulnerable because it may have a high
moisture content when it embarks. Moist ocean air provides even more
liquid to encourage microbiological growth. These problems can be
prevented by drying the ventilation air supplied to holds and shipping
containers. Drying the cargo prevents losses that can otherwise reach
millions of dollars in a single shipment.
Breweries
Brewing requires large amounts of heat, water and malted grain. These
are necessary for growing the yeast which turns natural sugars into
alcohol. Yeast is a beneficial fungus, but other microbes can also grow
in its place and disturb the brewing process.

CHAPTER FOUR
Moisture Regain Prevention
Virtually every substance has some affinity for moisture. Even plastic
resins like nylon can collect six to ten percent of their dry weight in
water vapor. In many cases, this presents no problem. In others, mois-
ture regain can affect critical dimensions just like thermal expansion, or
make products that would otherwise flow freely stick together. The
typical home salt shaker illustrates this point — moisture regain on
humid days clogs the shaker holes. On a dinner table, this may be a
minor problem. But in packaging machinery, sticky products have ma-
jor economic consequences.
Hygroscopic products are sensitive to high relative humidities rather
than absolute humidities, and relative humidity can be high at any time
of year. In fact it is often higher in winter than summer. When products
are stored at cool temperatures, problems can be especially acute. Des-
iccant dehumidifiers are effective in controlling humidity at low tem-
peratures, and have been widely applied to prevent moisture regain.

APPLICATIONS
Candy packaging
Hard candies often contain corn sugars and sorbitol, both of which are
highly hygroscopic. When humidity is high, the product can absorb
moisture and become sticky. Then it sticks to packaging machinery and
wrapping material, slowing the process and creating sanitary problems.

wrapping material, slowing the process and creating sanitary problems.
Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to keep packaging areas dry, letting
equipment run efficiently and reducing the cost and time required for
equipment cleaning.
Semiconductor and pharmaceutical clean rooms
When microcircuits are manufactured, hygroscopic polymers called
photoresists are used to mask circuit lines for etching. These polymers
are hygroscopic. If they absorb moisture, microscopic circuit lines are
cut or bridged, resulting in circuit failure. In pharmaceutical manufac-
turing many powders are highly hygroscopic. When moist, these are
difficult to process and have limited shelf-life. For these reasons and
others, clean rooms are equipped with desiccant dehumidifiers, which
prevent moisture absorption, allowing fast manufacturing of high-qual-
ity products.
Safety glass laminating
The thin, transparent plastic film which serves as the adhesive between
layers of safety glass is quite hygroscopic. If allowed to absorb mois-
ture, the film will boil it off in processing, creating steam bubbles
which get trapped in laminated glass. Desiccant dehumidifiers create
low-humidity environments for the manufacturing, storage and use of
this laminating adhesive.
Composite manufacturing
Many uncured epoxy resins have a high affinity for moisture.

Composite manufacturing
Many uncured epoxy resins have a high affinity for moisture. When
they absorb water vapor, the molecular sites which would otherwise
cross-link to form strong bonds are blocked by water molecules. This
slows down curing until the water is evaporated, or results in low
strength parts. Printed circuit boards, filament-wound aerospace parts
and pre-impregnated synthetic materials are all manufactured and
stored in low-humidity environments to speed processing and improve
product quality by preventing moisture regain.
56
CHAPTER FOUR
Product Drying
Most products are dried using hot air to vaporize moisture and carry it
away. Often, however, hot air is either too slow or results in damage to
the product. Enzymes, for instance, are destroyed by heat, and if yeast
is dried with very hot air, it cannot work properly.
When there is a benefit to drying at temperatures below 120°F, there is
generally a benefit to using air which has been dehumidified rather
than just heated. The cooler the temperature, the more the economics
favor dehumidifiers. In one installation for example, enzymes used in
commercial detergents are dried in a fluidized-bed drier. Because of the
temperatures involved, the drying capacity of the fluid bed is doubled
when the air dewpoint drops from 65°F to 20°. This means the size of
the fluid bed can be cut in half.

The range of product drying applications for dehumidifiers has ex-
panded significantly in recent years, as clients examine the positive
effects of low-temperature drying on product quality. Dehumidifiers
allow these quality improvements without sacrificing processing speed.

APPLICATIONS
Investment castings
In this process, wax patterns are repeatedly dipped in a ceramic slurry.
These layers build up to form a mold, which is filled with molten metal
after the wax is melted out. Dry air rather than heat is used to dry the
ceramic layers because hot air could deform the wax pattern.

dehumidifiers lets investment casters operate foundries at consistent
rates all year long, without having to allow for slower processing in
humid months. This lets manufacturers improve compliance with clean
air laws by substituting water for solvents. Productivity improves
considerably — in many situations drying time is reduced by over 50%.
Plastic resin drying
Plastic resins are all hygroscopic to some degree. The moisture they
absorb boils off when they are heated by the molding and extrusion
processes when plastic pellets are formed into products. This boiling
vapor creates structural and cosmetic flaws in the products, which
reduces their value. Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to dry plastic
pellets to very low moisture levels before they are melted, which im-
proves end-product quality and raises profits for the fabricator.
Candy coating
Any coated candy like gumballs or chocolate-covered nuts can benefit
from using dry air to speed drying. In the case of chocolate, high tem-
peratures would melt or dent the product. With gumballs, the gloss of
the coating is enhanced by using dry air, and the product is less likely
to stick together in the coating pan.

high-quality, glossy surface finish is almost always produced with the
aid of dry air from desiccant dehumidifiers.
Fish drying
Delicate foods like fish are very sensitive to heat. Ideally, they should
be dried at cold temperatures so bacteria will not grow and proteins
will not break down. Such problems affect texture, flavor and sanita-
tion. Desiccant dehumidifiers are used with cooling systems to dry fish
efficiently at low temperatures. Without dehumidifiers, drying times at
low temperatures would be too long to be economically practical.
58
CHAPTER FOUR
Dry Cooling
Air conditioning systems generally use cooling coils to control both air
temperature and humidity. In most comfort-conditioning applications,
this is an extremely efficient method of controlling humidity.
However, in some circumstances, there is a benefit to adding a desic-
cant dehumidifier to the cooling system to control humidity separately
from air temperature. The benefits are greatest where the moisture
loads are high compared to the sensible heat loads, or where they peak
at different times. For example, a building may be able to use 65°F
outside air for cooling, but the air will still be carrying enough mois-
ture to require dehumidification.

loads, or where they peak
at different times. For example, a building may be able to use 65°F
outside air for cooling, but the air will still be carrying enough mois-
ture to require dehumidification.
Also, when energy to regenerate a desiccant dehumidifier is very inex-
pensive and electric power is very costly, a desiccant unit can be a
useful addition to an air conditioning system. It shifts the moisture load
from electricity to a lower-cost utility. For example, cogeneration sys-
tems supply excess heat which can be used by a desiccant dehumidifier
to remove moisture from air.
Retrofitted HV AC systems also take advantage of desiccant moisture
removal capacity. This is of interest to many engineers since environ-
mental concerns about chlorinated fluorocarbon refrigerants can lead
to major changes in the latent removal capacities of existing systems.
Typical Applications
• Public buildings & auditoriums
• Nursing homes
• Health clubs
• Retail stores
• Hotels & motels
• Office building retrofits
• Supermarkets
• Medical office buildings
• Hospitals

APPLICATIONS
Supermarkets
When refrigerated display cases operate they chill the air, automatically
condensing large amounts of water. A desiccant dehumidifier removes
water vapor much less expensively than the cooling system in the
cases. If the air is already dry, cases do not condense moisture so they
run more efficiently.

equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars in merchandise sales. In
addition, since the store is dry, ice does not build up on frozen food
and ice cream, which makes these high-margin products more appeal-
ing to customers.
Hotels and motels
Transient accommodations and conference facilities have large peaks and
valleys in sensible heat loads. As people come and go, loads change radi-
cally. Moisture loads, on the other hand are quite constant because fresh air
is brought into the building constantly, bringing along water vapor. Conven-
tional cooling systems drop the room temperature so quickly that they shut
off, leaving the moisture to build up, causing moldy odors and damaging the
building structure and furnishings. Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to dry
make-up air very deeply, so it can act as a “sponge” to remove excess hu-
midity. This improves customer satisfaction and reduces maintenance costs.
Sick buildings
When air is cooled by a vapor-compression cooling system, it leaves
the cooling coil essentially saturated with moisture. In some cases, the
ducts downstream and the drain pan of the coil provide breeding places
for mold and fungus. This growth contributes to indoor air quality
problems and creates moldy odors.

useful feature in systems for medical facilities or other buildings where
indoor air quality is an issue.
Advanced HVAC systems
Heating and air conditioning (HV AC) systems that use cogeneration for
electrical power produce excess heat which comes from cooling the gen-
erator. This energy can be used to regenerate a desiccant dehumidifier,
which removes the moisture load from the cooling system, improving
overall system efficiency and saving operating costs. Also, systems
which use ice storage to take advantage of low-cost electrical power can
use desiccant dehumidifiers to produce very dry air. The combination of
very dry and very cool air allows the system to reduce the total volume
of air in the system, which in turn reduces the cost of ductwork installa-
tion and fan operation.

CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS

hen designing dehumidification installations, there are few
tasks as important as quantifying the moisture loads that
must be removed by the system. Without a clear understand-
ing of the dimension of the loads, their frequency and source, it is im-
possible to design a system to remove them.
While the task is essential, moisture load calculation has historically
been a somewhat controversial and personal procedure. That may seem
odd, given the detailed calculations and apparently well-defined tables
and graphs developed to assist the engineer. But the uncomfortable fact
remains that two equally qualified individuals may arrive at different
total moisture loads for the same space.
Differences arise from differing assumptions.

t the engineer. But the uncomfortable fact
remains that two equally qualified individuals may arrive at different
total moisture loads for the same space.
Differences arise from differing assumptions. Calculations for moisture
leakage through a wall can be the same, but can the designer be sure
the contractor will really seal the electrical junction boxes, or will the
vapor barrier really be taped as specified? Will the room supervisor
really control access to the space, or will doors be opening constantly?
The engineer must make many assumptions — best estimates — before
the calculation and system design can proceed.
In the final analysis, the moisture load calculation sheet represents a
common agreement between equipment supplier, system designer,
owner and installer. It defines the assumptions that form the founda-
tion of the system design.
This chapter will discuss the basic elements of moisture loads, how
they can be quantified, and most importantly, the relative importance
of each element in different situations.
62
CHAPTER FIVE
Selecting Design Conditions
The greater the difference in moisture between the controlled space
and the surrounding environment, the greater the load will be from
each load element. For example, assume a building is controlled at
70°F and 50% relative humidity (56 gr/lb), and the surrounding
weather in the summertime is 90° and 95 gr/lb.

r the load will be from
each load element. For example, assume a building is controlled at
70°F and 50% relative humidity (56 gr/lb), and the surrounding
weather in the summertime is 90° and 95 gr/lb. Then each pound of
air infiltrating into the room brings 39 grains of moisture that must be
removed by the dehumidifier. But if the building is controlled at 70°
and 2% rh (1.8 gr/lb), each pound of infiltrating air brings 93.2 grains
into the room. With this in mind, it becomes clear that the first and
most important step in calculating moisture loads is to determine the
temperature and moisture conditions inside and outside the controlled
space.
The internal condition is determined by the product or process, and
there are as many possible specifications as there are different applica-
tions. The important point about the control level is that it must be
specified in absolute terms—grains per pound—before any calculations
can proceed.
For instance; “30% relative humidity” is not a useful specification,
because the moisture content of air at 30% rh varies with temperature.
When the engineer further defines the temperature to be 70°F, the rela-
tive humidity value can be converted to an absolute value by consult-
ing a psychrometric chart. In this case, 70°F and 30% rh is a moisture
content of 32 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air.

tive humidity value can be converted to an absolute value by consult-
ing a psychrometric chart. In this case, 70°F and 30% rh is a moisture
content of 32 grains of water vapor per pound of dry air.
If the application calls for a constant 30% humidity at fluctuating tem-
perature, the designer must pick the temperature that — at 30% rh —
will represent the greatest difference in absolute moisture between the
inside and outside conditions. This is often the lowest temperature in
the expected range, although the moisture difference will depend on
what is happening outside at the time the low temperature and mois-
ture condition occurs inside.
There are actually two sets of “outside” conditions which must be se-
lected for the moisture load calculation. The first includes the condi-
tions immediately surrounding the controlled space. These will be used
to calculate loads from wall surface permeation, door openings and air
FIGURE 5.1
Loads depend on moisture
differentials
All other things being equal, the moisture
load is proportional to the difference
between the specific humidity difference
between the controlled space and the
surrounding environment. The larger the
difference, the greater the load.

In standard air conditioning design practice, an engineer often uses
weather data compiled by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Re-
frigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) which is contained in table
1B of chapter 27 of the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals . How-
ever, that table contains three sets of design extremes, all of which
have values for moisture. When designing dehumidification systems,
use the values for the peak dew point, not for the peak dry bulb or peak
wet bulb temperatures. Select one of the values from columns 4b, 4c or
4h of table 1B. Do not use the values from columns 2 or 3, because
those are for cooling or evaporative cooling calculations. Peak cooling
loads occur under drier conditions than do the peak dew point condi-
tions. At most locations, the absolute humidity is 20 to 40% higher
during peak dew point conditions than it is during peak dry bulb con-
ditions.
The owner must apply some judgment to the selection of the outdoor
design conditions. In columns 4b,4c and 4h, the owner has the choice
of selecting extremes of moisture that are not likely to be exceeded for
either 0.

could exceed the designers estimates for at least 175 hours during a
typical year. The risk of being out of control for seven days — or parts
of many more days — may be acceptable in some situations and not in
others. The client must decide how conservatively the system should
be designed.

outside of the locations reprinted in this book, you may find it helpful
to consult the ASHRAE Handbook itself, or the ASHRAE Humidity Con-

CHAPTER FIVE
Moisture Load Sources
There are seven principal sources of moisture:
• Permeation through floors, walls and ceiling
• Evaporation from peoples clothing, breath and perspiration
• Desorption from moist products, including packaging materials
• Evaporation from wet surfaces or open tanks
• Generation from combustion — open flame in the space
• Air infiltration through leaks, holes and door openings
• Fresh air ventilation from outside the space.
The importance of each of these sources depends on its size compared
to the other sources, which varies by individual circumstances. Later in
the chapter, we will review some examples which illustrate this point
with specific numbers. But for the moment, it is useful to remember
that the larger the individual load element, the more it demands careful
attention. Conversely, if the load element is small, the details of its
calculation may be less important to the success of the project.
Permeation moisture
Water vapor moves through solid materials at a rate proportional to the
difference in vapor pressures on either side of the material. The mois-
ture moves faster if the condition on one side of a wall is very dry than
if air on both sides are similar in absolute moisture content.

ce in vapor pressures on either side of the material. The mois-
ture moves faster if the condition on one side of a wall is very dry than
if air on both sides are similar in absolute moisture content.
Also, each material has a different permeance rating, according to how
much water vapor it will pass per square foot in a given period of time
at a given vapor pressure differential. Since moisture travels through air
more quickly than through solids, the permeance factor strongly de-
pends on porosity of the material.
For example, a film of polyethylene plastic only .006 inches thick
passes moisture at a rate of 0.06 grains per hour per square foot per
inch of mercury column vapor pressure difference. On the other hand,
an 8 inch thick concrete aggregate block passes 2.4 grains per hour,
which is forty times faster than the film even though the thickness of
the block is 1300 times greater than the plastic.
The vapor pressure difference is directly proportional to the difference
between the specific humidity levels on either side of the material. In
the normal range of engineering interest, each gr/lb of moisture corre-
sponds to 0.0067in.Hg. vapor pressure. The designer can use this value
to calculate vapor pressure difference when the difference across a

Moisture from products and packaging
If a solid material and surrounding air are in equilibrium, the moisture
content of the material is proportional to the relative humidity of the
surrounding air. Most solid materials absorb moisture from the air
when it is moist, and give up the moisture when the surrounding air
is dry.

Content:
 material is proportional to the relative humidity of the
surrounding air. Most solid materials absorb moisture from the air
when it is moist, and give up the moisture when the surrounding air
is dry.
When a moist material is brought into a dry environment, it will give
up moisture until the water vapor pressure at its surface is the same as
the vapor pressure in the surrounding air. The surface vapor pressure
of a solid material depends primarily on its chemical and physical
structure. So each material has different equilibrium characteristics.
Surface vapor pressure is also proportional to both material tempera-
ture and moisture content, but since most controlled spaces are held at
relatively constant temperature, moisture sorption and desorption has
the deceptive appearance of being a function of relative humidity. Actu-
ally, there is a different moisture content — relative humidity equilib-
rium relationship for each different air and material temperature.

Product moisture
Materials collect and hold moisture
when they are exposed to a humid
environment. When they move to a

the moisture they collected. This
moisture load can be significant in
applications like warehouses, where
large amounts of moist cardboard
packing material enter and leave the

Figure 5.4 describes the equilibrium moisture contents of several differ-
ent materials when their temperature is a constant 75°F. To calculate
how much moisture they will give off when brought into a dry room,
solve the following equation:
EQUATION 5.3
Equilibrium moisture content of material at
the control condition in the space (lbs/lb)
Water vapor from products & packaging
(lbs/hr)
Wpp = lbs /hr × ( pw1
− pw2 )

entering the space (lbs/lb)

every hour (lbs/hr)

CHAPTER FIVE
Note that this equation makes the very conservative assumption that
all the water vapor that can be desorbed from the material will be re-
leased in one hour. In fact, the process may take considerably longer.
The exact rate depends on a host of variables — primarily the air veloc-
ity across the moist surface, the energy available for evaporation and
the thickness of the material.

take considerably longer.
The exact rate depends on a host of variables — primarily the air veloc-
ity across the moist surface, the energy available for evaporation and
the thickness of the material. For example, thin sheets of paper located
under a warm, dry air discharge duct will dry within a few minutes.
But cardboard boxes filled with paper and stacked on top of one an-
other on a pallet make take days or even weeks to desorb moisture and
reach a new equilibrium.
When the dehumidification system is designed primarily to dry a wet
product like investment castings, seeds or powders, the equilibrium
chart presented here will not be especially useful. Each product drying
application is quite unique because the product is presented to the air a
different way. Also, the product will have very specific and unique
limitations of temperature, drying rate and drying air dew point. Ex-
periments will be necessary to determine these characteristics. How-
ever, the engineer often has some methods of rough estimating at his
disposal.
For instance, in an investment casting operation, the consumption rate
of casting solutions must be known, because it represents a major cost
item in the process. Since the water content of the solution is also
known, the engineer can estimate water vapor load in pounds per hour
by multiplying the number of gallons consumed per hour by 8.34 (wa-
ter weighs 8.34 lbs per gallon).

ture load in a supermarket evaporating from moist vegetables. The
manufacturer of the vegetable spraying system supplies the spraying
rate for the equipment in gallons per hour, so the moisture load in lbs
per hour is derived by multiplying the spraying rate in GPH by 8.34.
FIGURE 5.6
Product moisture loads
When a newly-constructed room is
equipped with a dehumidifier, it may take
some time before all the product moisture is
pulled out of the material and into the air.
The materials reach a temporary equilibrium
after the surface moisture is removed. As the
moisture migrates from the center to the
edge of the material, more water vapor is
liberated, and eventually the product
reaches a true equilibrium.
If batches of moist product are brought into
the room periodically, they will each behave
like the building materials, loosing moisture
in two stages. The net effect is that after
initial construction, the moisture load
varies as the building dries out. Even if a
dehumidifier is running, the room humidity
level can be expected to fluctuate somewhat
until the building materials stop adding
moisture to the air.

Moisture from personnel
People breathe out moisture and release water vapor by perspiring.
They also carry moisture into a low humidity space in their clothes.
Each time someone breathes out, they release a lungful of air at a con-
dition of 98°F and 283 grains per pound — essentially saturated. The
number of breaths of air depends largely on the person’s physical activ-
ity. More active people will breath more frequently and deeply. The
chart provides typical moisture release rates for people engaged in dif-
ferent degrees of physical activity.

In addition to this moisture, if a large number of people enter and leave
the conditioned space frequently rather than simply staying in the
room, the designer may need to consider water vapor from moist cloth-
ing. This is calculated like moisture desorbed from products and pack-
aging materials. In most circumstances, the net amount of water vapor
from clothes is almost negligible. However, when moisture control con-
ditions are very low — below 5% relative humidity — or the personnel
traffic very high, moisture desorbed from clothing can be significant.

super-dry rooms (below 2% rh) for

Apparently, people adapt to the low

moisture indicated by the graph at left.

CHAPTER FIVE
For example, commercial buildings like supermarkets have a high mois-
ture load from clothing since customers can enter the space directly
from rainy, humid weather. Theaters and conference facilities may also
have high intermittent loads from groups of people who enter from wet
weather.
Moisture from combustion
In spaces where open gas burners are used for heating, the moisture
that results from combustion can be a significant load. The exact
amount of water vapor produced will vary with the composition of the
gas, but where the value is unknown, the engineer can estimate that
each cubic foot of gas burned produces 650 grains of water vapor.

Moisture evaporated from wet surfaces
In many food processing applications, the equipment in the space must
be periodically washed and the floors cleaned. Also, in water treatment
plants, there may be large, open tanks from which water will evaporate
into the air. The rate of evaporation is directly proportional to the dif-
ference in vapor pressure between the surface and air, and also propor-
tional to the rate that heat is transferred to the surface water film. The
heat provides the energy necessary for evaporation, and the difference
in vapor pressure provides the driving force to lift the water from the
liquid surface into the air.

CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS
The water surface vapor pressure is high if the water temperature is
high, since the air boundary layer is essentially saturated at the water
temperature. So the highest evaporation rates occur when the water
surface is warm, the air dry and when air travels rapidly and turbu-
lently across the water surface. Fast, turbulent airflow provides high
heat transfer rates from the air to the water film, and high mass trans-
fer rates from the water to the air.
These relationships are expressed in the graph on the previous page,
and the following equation, which originated from Dr. Willis Carrier’s
research in the 1920’s:

Moisture from air leaks through cracks and holes
No building or air handling system is hermetically sealed. All rooms
and ductwork will leak a certain amount of air, which carries a certain
amount of moisture into the conditioned space. Typical air leak loca-
tions include:
• Cracks at duct joints
• Gaps in the vapor barrier film at wall-ceiling, wall-floor and wall-wall
joints
• Gaps between wallboard and electrical fixtures that penetrate the wall
• Electrical conduits through which wires pass into a room
• Oversized holes for pipe and duct wall penetrations
• Gaps where strips of vapor barrier film are overlapped but not taped
• Cracks at access doors of air handling equipment casings
• Wall or ceiling penetrations to pass products in and out of the room
• Old ventilation louvres in walls and doors
• Cracks between the doors and their frames and sills.
• Open construction above hung ceilings
• Open doorways, loading docks or doorways with plastic strip curtains
FIGURE 5.12
Air infiltration
The moisture load carried into the room by
air flowing through cracks and wall
penetrations is far more important than the
load which results from diffusion through
materials.

penetrations is far more important than the
load which results from diffusion through
materials. For example, a crack 1/16th inch
thick and 1 foot long will leak moisture at a
rate of 1480 grains per hour in a light
breeze. In contrast, an entire painted
concrete block wall measuring 10 feet tall by
50 ft long will only leak 87 grains per hour
under the same circumstances.

The simplicity of this equation is somewhat deceptive. The difficulty
comes in establishing the open area of numerous small cracks and
holes, and in determining the air velocity through the openings. Differ-
ences in assumptions concerning these values are the root of differ-
ences between calculations performed by two equally well qualified
system designers. Some of the issues and different approaches to the

• Exterior wall leakage
Light commercial and industrial buildings sided with vertical, rolled
steel panels present a classic problem in estimating air infiltration. In
theory, the metal walls should be an excellent vapor barrier, but in fact,
the siding can leak air through seams between panels, and where walls
meet other walls, the ceiling and floor. There are thousands of feet of
potential cracks.
FIGURE 5.13
Air density nomograph
Air infiltration is measured in cubic feet
per unit time, but the weight of the air —
therefore the weight ratio of water vapor
to air (gr.lb.) — depends on air density
per cubic foot. Density changes with
temperature and total pressure. This
nomograph allows the designer to find
the correct density per cubic foot for
different air temperatures and pressures.
73
CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS
When working with an existing building, the designer can measure
infiltration quite accurately by engaging an air test and balance con-
tractor to perform a blower-door test of the building’s ability to main-
tain both positive and negative internal air pressures. The building is
closed, a special panel equipped with a fan covers the door, and then
the pressure differential across the building wall is compared with the
fan airflow. Then the airflow is reversed and measured once again.

the pressure differential across the building wall is compared with the
fan airflow. Then the airflow is reversed and measured once again.
Measurements for both positive and negative pressures are important
since some openings, cracks and gaskets leak more readily in one di-
rection than the other. For example, window seals are designed to resist
infiltration from outside the building, but will blow away from the
frame if the building is placed under positive pressure, leading to a
false conclusion about actual infiltration potential. Properly performed,
such blower-door tests measure air leakage more accurately than what
can be determined with theoretical calculations.
For larger spaces, the U.S. Brookhaven National Laboratory has devel-
oped a tracer gas air infiltration measurement technique called the
AIMS test. A tracer gas emitter and receiver are placed in the space for
a two to four week period. Then the receiver is sent to a laboratory for
analysis. The amount of tracer gas it collected is inversely proportional
to the air leakage. In other words, as air leaks in and out of the build-
ing, there is less gas absorbed by the receiver because it has been di-
luted by the fresh air. Details of this procedure are available from the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Buildings Research
Division.

Chapter 23 of the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals  deals exten-
sively with the subject of air infiltration through the building envelope.
The information in the tables presented here has been adapted from
that data, and provides a means of estimating exterior wall leakage on
buildings that have not yet been constructed.
In using the tables, note that if all four sides of a conditioned space are
exposed to the weather, not all will be receiving full wind pressure
simultaneously. Once the air leak rate has been established, the de-
signer can use the following equation to establish the moisture load
through an exterior wall.

Products riding on a conveyor will push air out of the room at roughly
the speed of the conveyor belt. The air will be replaced by a counter-
flowing moist airstream which enters through the same opening below
and beside the conveyor. A conservative calculation assumes the full
open area of the wall opening has moist air flowing into the room at
the speed of the conveyor. Designers can apply judgment to each situa-
tion, perhaps reducing the open area assumption if plastic strip cur-
tains are placed over the opening, or very flat product rides the

• Moisture infiltration against out-flowing air
To prevent moisture from being carried into a room by air currents,
system designers often bring enough fresh air through the dehumidifi-
cation system to provide a slight positive pressure on the room relative
to the surrounding area. That way, air is always flowing out of rather
than into the room through cracks, wall openings and doors.

CHAPTER FIVE
In past years, system designers believed that counterflow infiltration
was caused by the large vapor pressure difference between moist air
outside the room and dry air inside. Since the vapor pressure difference
can be measured in inches of mercury, and air pressure simply in
inches of water column, engineers reasoned that the vapor pressure
difference could overcome air pressure differences and result in mois-
ture flowing against an airstream. In fact, recent research has shown
that while true, the absolute amount of moisture transferred by this
diffusion mechanism is very small — even negligible — compared to
that transferred by two other mechanisms: thermal differences across a
large opening and velocity-induced, low-pressure areas at the edges of
small openings.

very small — even negligible — compared to
that transferred by two other mechanisms: thermal differences across a
large opening and velocity-induced, low-pressure areas at the edges of
small openings.
Purely empirical experience suggests that maintaining 150 feet per
minute out-flowing air velocity will reduce the counter-flowing mois-
ture to negligible amounts provided that precautions are taken by the
designer. For large, tall openings like warehouse doors, plastic strip
curtains are used to block airflow resulting from pressure differences
created by thermal differences across the opening. The airflow neces-
sary to maintain 150 feet per minute is calculated using the remaining
open area after the strip curtain is installed, remembering that there are
still cracks between the strips which open and close with air movement
and door activity.
In smaller openings, counter-flowing air infiltration can be limited by
installing short (two foot long) tunnels around the opening. This moves
the low-pressure area at the edge of the opening outside the room,
effectively eliminating counterflow air at 150 foot per minute outward
air velocities.
This experience is presented for the designer’s information, but should
be used with the clear understanding that the theoretical basis of the
empirical evidence is weak and all mechanisms of moisture transport
in this situation are not well understood.

150 fpm, tunnels and plastic strips appear to work well in limiting
counterflow infiltration at higher humidity control levels, but when
moisture differentials are very large, such as when a room is being
maintained below 15% relative humidity at 70°F, they do not appear to
be effective. In those situations, the designer must assume that mois-
ture does enter through the opening in spite of these precautions. Con-
servative calculations assume a 50 foot per minute airflow into the
room through the full area of the opening.

Moisture infiltration through smaller
openings can be greatly reduced by
providing enough air to the room to
maintain an outward air velocity of 150
feet per minute. But the beneficial effect
is limited unless the opening is ducted, so
that low pressure areas caused by the
high velocity are moved well outside the
room wall.

wind velocity governs the airflow rate though the door for the amount
of time the door is open. If a door opens to another space, assume
there is an air current of 50 feet per minute into the room for the time
the door remains open, unless there is better specific data available.
• Air infiltration through air lock vestibules
A double-door air-locked vestibule is a common feature of many low-
humidity rooms. Dehumidification system economics make airlocks
almost essential for cold storage facilities and dryrooms maintaining air
dew points below 10°F. A conservative calculation assumes that each
time the air lock is opened, the air in the lock comes to a moisture
condition half way between the condition outside the room and the
moisture level inside:

• Number of door openings per hour
The most fragile estimate a designer will make is his or her judgment
of the number of times a door will be opened in a typical hour. If the
room has been built and is being used, the designer is urged to perform
a visual survey of door activity, or install a counting mechanism. The
number of door openings will generally be surprisingly high. The activ-
ity is seldom less than two door openings per person per hour, and
often much higher.
The moisture load this represents can be discouraging. It prompts the
designer to have heart-to-heart conversations with supervisors about
minimizing door activity, and then use a more optimistic and smaller
number of openings for calculations. However, the designer should
remember that supervisors and personnel change, and if the system is
short of capacity, nobody is likely to remember promises made years
earlier by different people. When in doubt, the designer is encouraged
to make conservative rather than optimistic estimates of door activity.

CHAPTER FIVE
Periodic vs. continuous loads
In the calculations above, we have treated moisture loads as a continu-
ous, even flow of moisture into the room from a variety of sources—
essentially a constant rate every hour. In fact, loads seldom occur so
uniformly. For example, people entering a dry room for work will do so
at 7:00 am and leave for a lunch break at 12:00 noon. So the number of
door openings per hour is very high at the beginning of the shift and at
the end, and between those times, the door activity is very low. The
designer has two choices: average the intermittent loads or use the
peak hourly load for the calculation. Each choice has advantages and
drawbacks.
If the designer uses the peak intermittent load, the system will always
have enough capacity to maintain control conditions, but it will be
oversized for average circumstances. This means the system will be
difficult to control, will use a large amount of energy and will cost
more to install. If the designer averages the peak loads with periods of
low loads, the system will be easier to control than a larger system, and
will cost less to install and operate. On the other hand, it may not have
enough capacity to maintain conditions if all peak loads occur simulta-
neously.

e easier to control than a larger system, and
will cost less to install and operate. On the other hand, it may not have
enough capacity to maintain conditions if all peak loads occur simulta-
neously.
The issue is only as important as the size of the intermittent load. If the
intermittent load is small compared to the total load, a minor excursion
from the control condition may be inconsequential. Likewise, it may
not be important to maintain control when the intermittent load oc-
curs. For instance, it is seldom important that the humidity level rises
when a food plant is sprayed down for cleaning — the more important
issue is how long it will take to dry. However, if the maximum humid-
ity level is critical, the designer should make plans to design a large
system to handle the peak load, or design a second system to supple-
ment the basic system when large, intermittent loads occur.
Fresh air moisture load
All of the moisture loads discussed above are internal. That is to say
they occur inside the room, which is down stream of the system. How-
ever, generally the largest moisture load originates in the fresh air
brought to the system upstream of the dehumidifier. Any moisture
carried by fresh air will be removed before it enters the room. This is
important, because if fresh air moisture went directly to the room, the
system would have to be much larger.

The designer must decide if it is important
to maintain control at these peak times, or if
it may be better to run the risk of being out
of control for short periods in order to
reduce the cost of the system and improve
its operating efficiency. The decision
generally depends on the relative size of the
periodic loads and therefore how long a
smaller  system would take to recover from
load peaks—minutes, hours or days.

CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS
For example, assume a system produces air at a moisture level of 25
gr/lb in order to maintain a control level of 30 gr/lb in the room. If
the internal moisture load is 40,000 grains per hour, the system must
supply 1,777 cfm of 25 grain air to maintain the 30 grain condition.
Dry air requirements are calculated as follows:
EQUATION 5.11
Air flow rate required to remove the moisture
load while maintaining the specified control
level in the space (cfm)

If 100 cfm of air at 120 gr/lb is brought directly to the room from the
weather for ventilation, it adds 40,500 grains per hour to the internal
load. Solving the same equation for a total internal load of 80,500 gr/hr
shows the system must now supply 3,577 cfm at 25 gr/lb to maintain
the 30 grain control condition, more than doubling the size of the
system.
This is why fresh air moisture is removed by the system before it enters
the room whenever possible — the practice results in smaller, more
cost-effective dehumidification systems. Therefore, the designer should
be careful not to simply add the ventilation load to the internal loads
during calculations —  it would lead to grossly oversized systems.
There are three reasons to bring fresh air into a system: to provide ven-
tilation for people and make-up air for exhaust hoods or fans, or to
maintain a positive air pressure in the room compared to the surround-
ing environment. The amount of air for each of these functions will
vary considerably between different applications.

CHAPTER FIVE
• Ventilation for people
ASHRAE standard 62-1999 (Ventilation for acceptable indoor air qual-
ity) establishes a minimum fresh air requirement of 15 to 25 cfm per
person. The exact amount varies according to the type of building and
it’s use. However, local building codes can vary. The designer is obliged
to follow local law where it requires more ventilation than the mini-
mum amounts suggested by ASHRAE in their Standard 62.
• Make-up air for exhaust fans
Fume hoods pull air from the room which must be replaced by fresh air
from outside. The amount will vary depending on the size of the hood
and the individual fan characteristics. Most fume hoods pull enough air
to maintain an air velocity of 150 feet per minute across the open hood
area. But designs vary considerably, so the designer must check the air
quantity with the hood manufacturer. The same conversation must
cover the issue of fan control.

 per minute across the open hood
area. But designs vary considerably, so the designer must check the air
quantity with the hood manufacturer. The same conversation must
cover the issue of fan control. If the hood fan is not controlled it will
pull air from the room at different rates depending on pressures inside
and outside the hood system. In any humidity-control application with
an exhaust fan, the designer must insure its airflow is known and
controlled.
• Make-up air for room pressurization
The amount of air necessary to develop and maintain a positive room
pressure depends on the open area through which air will leak out of
the room, and the shape of the edges of the openings. Fan Engineering,
a handbook published by the Buffalo Forge Company of Buffalo, NY,
provides the following formula for estimating airflow necessary to de-
velop a specified positive pressure on one side of a rectangular, square-
edged opening:
EQUATION 5.12
Q = 4005 × 0. 6 0× A × SP
Calculation factor (dimensionless)
Air flow rate required to maintain a specified
positive air pressure in a room with a
square-edged wall opening (cfm)
Coefficient of entry for air entering a square-
edged opening (dimensionless)
Area of the opening (sq.ft.)
Specified static pressure differential (in.wc.)
For smaller, crack-like openings, the relationship changes somewhat
because of the greater airflow resistance of turbulence at the edges
compared to smooth flow through the middle of the opening.

For smaller, crack-like openings, the relationship changes somewhat

compared to smooth flow through the middle of the opening. The last
term in the equation changes from SP
0.5 (the square root of static pres-
sure) to SP0.65.

CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS
When the total fresh air requirement is known, the designer can calcu-
late the moisture load it represents for the system. Note that if an ex-
haust system or room pressurization air operates continuously, it may
satisfy part or all of the requirement for personnel ventilation.

Sample moisture load calculations
As described at the beginning of this chapter, load calculations require
a series of assumptions beyond simple, quantifiable equations. Two
equally qualified and experienced individuals working separately may
well come to different conclusions on the same project.
For best results, the equipment supplier, system designer, installing
contractor and end user must all be aware of each assumption, and
they should agree on the final value for each load element.

For best results, the equipment supplier, system designer, installing
contractor and end user must all be aware of each assumption, and
they should agree on the final value for each load element.
The examples which follow show the typical thought process and sub-
sequent mathematics for two different kinds of projects: a relatively
passive storage application where the moisture control level is quite
high, and an active manufacturing environment where the loads are
high and the moisture control level is low.
Beyond these two examples, Chapter 7 (System Design) provides five
more projects which include load calculations, although in somewhat
less numerical detail than what appears here.

CHAPTER FIVE
Warehouse dehumidification
An electro-mechanical parts manufacturing operation located in
Chicago, Illinois stores a finished inventory of machined parts and raw
material in an older warehouse near the plant. There has been a prob-
lem with corrosion on highly polished surfaces. The purpose of this
project is to limit the relative humidity to a maximum of 40% at all
times of the year, in order to eliminate the re-work that results from
corrosion.
The project engineer examines the weather data for the local area and
decides to use summer extreme conditions of 95°F and 146 gr/lb, and
winter design extremes of -5°F and 4 gr/lb. These are the 1% extremes.

ect engineer examines the weather data for the local area and
decides to use summer extreme conditions of 95°F and 146 gr/lb, and
winter design extremes of -5°F and 4 gr/lb. These are the 1% extremes.
The engineer reasons that while using them will result in a large sys-
tem, the annual cost of rework has exceeded $250,000, so the incre-
mental cost of a larger dehumidification system is likely to be paid
back in a matter of months. Chicago is at an elevation of 658 ft above
sea level, so the engineer will use an air density of 0.070 lbs/cu.ft. for
calculations. The average annual ground water temperature in the area
is 52°F, which the engineer will need to calculate moisture permeation
through the concrete floor.
To establish the inside temperature and moisture control conditions for
the calculations, the engineer must determine what the lowest moisture
content will be inside when the moisture is highest outside — in other
words, the conditions which create the largest vapor pressure differen-
tial. Local weather data suggests that the extreme outside moisture of
146 gr/lb occurs when the outside dry bulb temperature is 85°F. At that
outside temperature, the building is generally at 75°F. The internal
moisture level will be 52 gr/lb when inside conditions are 75° and
40%rh.
The building measures 250 ft long, 75 ft wide and 14 ft high. It is at-
tached to the plant by a passageway for transport of material. There are
two loosely-fitted doors measuring 10 ft x 10 ft.

The building measures 250 ft long, 75 ft wide and 14 ft high. It is at-
tached to the plant by a passageway for transport of material. There are
two loosely-fitted doors measuring 10 ft x 10 ft. One door opens into
the plant passageway, and the other is a loading dock. The loading
dock door opens about twice an hour for thirty seconds each as trucks
pull into and out of the loading platform. The plant passageway door
opens eight times an hour, also for an average of thirty seconds each
time so material can pass to and from the warehouse.
The building walls are brick, 8.5 inches thick, and the interior
surface has been painted with a vapor-retarding industrial latex paint.
The floor is an 8 inch thick concrete slab, poured on packed crushed
stone without a vapor barrier. The roofing is metal-deck, built-up
construction.
83
CALCULATION OF MOISTURE LOADS
Two packing and inventory clerks work in the building during the day
shift, and the parts are packed in heavy cardboard on wooden pallets.
The cardboard totals approximately 5,000 lbs dry weight. The material
turns over about six times a year.
Inside the building, the space is open, without partitions or internal
rooms. There is no air cooling system or fresh air ventilation apart from
what leaks in through the building walls.
The calculation sheets on the following pages show how the load is
calculated.

rooms. There is no air cooling system or fresh air ventilation apart from
what leaks in through the building walls.
The calculation sheets on the following pages show how the load is
calculated. Some of the engineer’s thoughts include:
• Weather design conditions
The biggest problems with corrosion seem to occur in the spring and
fall, when rising weather air moisture actually causes condensation on
the cool metal surfaces of the raw material and finished parts. The
engineer could have chosen a lower spring or fall moisture extreme,
but decides to take the summer condition for maximum safety. How-
ever, since the dehumidifier must operate year round, the engineer will
select the reactivation heaters based on the winter air temperature to
insure adequate heater capacity for desiccant regeneration.
• Building penetrations
The weather gets very muggy and uncomfortable during summer
months, and the roof of the building has ventilators installed to avoid
heat build-up in the warehouse. These must be covered with plywood
and sealed with metal foil tape. The engineer assumes this will be
done, and also allows a modest budget for small, portable “man-
cooler” units for the workers assigned to the building. Also, the two
inactive doors are sealed with metal foil tape to avoid air leaks, and the
broken glass panel in one of the active doors is replaced.

ler” units for the workers assigned to the building. Also, the two
inactive doors are sealed with metal foil tape to avoid air leaks, and the
broken glass panel in one of the active doors is replaced. Finally, the
oversized wall openings for the heater vent pipes and gas supply pipes
are sealed with sheet metal collars and glass fiber insulation.
• Observations concerning the loads
Calculations show the importance of limiting air infiltration through
cracks and door openings. An investment in sealant and better gaskets
would allow a smaller, less costly system with lower operating costs.
The even larger load comes from the open shipping door. The load
could be reduced somewhat by plastic strips in addition to the solid
door, and it may help to put an alarm light or bell on the door to re-
mind workers to close the door as rapidly as possible after a truck pulls
through. Also note that another coat of vapor-barrier paint or expen-
sive vapor barrier film to limit permeation would not change the load
by any significant amount. The owner will be better served by concen-
trating on reducing cracks and shortening door opening times.

CHAPTER FIVE
Glass lamination room
A manufacturer of automobile windows in Dallas, Texas is expanding a
plant where glass sheets are laminated. The process uses thin films of
polyvinyl butyral plastic as the adhesive between the glass sheets, and
the plastic is hygroscopic. If the plastic has absorbed moisture, the
water vaporizes during the autoclaving process, which traps bubbles
within the laminated sheets. The windows would then be unusable.
The purpose of the project is to prevent the plastic from regaining
moisture by maintaining the room at 20% relative humidity. The tem-
perature is not critical, but should remain comfortable for workers, and
temperature swings should be avoided so the large plastic sheets do
not expand and contract. The designer decides on 70°F as the control
temperature, which means that 20%rh represents an air moisture con-
tent of 22 gr/lb.
The room will be built inside an existing plant which is semi-cooled in
the summer to temperatures that can reach 80°F and 50% relative hu-
midity. The raw material enters the room from a warehouse that is
not climate-controlled. Conditions will approach the ambient design
extremes of 102°F and 146 gr/lb.

not climate-controlled. Conditions will approach the ambient design
extremes of 102°F and 146 gr/lb. T o minimize moisture infiltration
from the warehouse when product enters the room, the designer has
arranged an air lock vestibule for the product door. Raw material deliv-
eries vary somewhat, but seem to peak at a rate of 4 times per hour.
The cardboard material packaging brings some moisture into the room.
The packaging weight is 15 lbs for material consumed in an hour.
There are five workers in the room, and occasional traffic from supervi-
sors and machine technicians. The designer allows for five permanent
employees and three transient people in the room simultaneously. A
door counter on an existing room suggests the personnel door will be
opened 16 times each hour during production. The door measures 30
inches by 6 ft, 6 inches. Unfortunately, the space around the personnel
door will not accommodate an air lock.
A conveyor carries the finished product out of the room through an
opening in the wall that measures 2 ft. high by 4 ft. wide. The designer
decides to equip the conveyor opening with a short tunnel as well as a
plastic strip curtain at each end of the tunnel. There will also be some
fresh air brought into the room for the personnel. This air will exit
through the conveyor opening, further minimizing moist air infiltration.

The room measures 60 ft long by 40 ft wide and 10 ft high. One of the
four walls forms part of the exterior wall of the building, the other
separates the process from the rest of the plant. The floor is an 8 inch

thick concrete slab on grade and the walls are all concrete block with
an interior finish that includes an aluminized plastic film vapor-re-
tarder covered by plywood and vinyl wall covering. The ceiling of the
room is the formed concrete “waffle-grid” slab that acts as the second
floor of the building. It has been painted with two coats of an indus-
trial latex vapor-retarder paint.
The engineer must make judgments concerning:
• Relative humidity in the warehouse
Packaging material for raw material from the warehouse will give off
moisture, but what is the original moisture content? The design ex-
tremes of temperature and moisture translate to 47% relative humidity,
but the engineer knows that as the dry bulb drops in the evening, the
relative humidity rises. A simple humidity indicator placed in the ware-
house suggests the typical relative humidity is 80% in the summer. The
designer uses that figure for calculations, since even if it were wrong by
100%, it would not drastically affect the total load.

house suggests the typical relative humidity is 80% in the summer. The
designer uses that figure for calculations, since even if it were wrong by
100%, it would not drastically affect the total load.
• Volume of fresh air
Local codes require 20 cfm per person fresh air ventilation, which
would total 160 cfm for the eight people expected in the room. But the
engineer wants to minimize moist air infiltration through doors, cracks
and especially the conveyor opening. The opening measures 2 ft. high
by 4 ft. wide, and the strip curtains cover the open area, except when
product exits on the conveyor. The engineer wants to maintain 150 fpm
outward air velocity. She assumes the product will force open the cur-
tains so that one half of the opening will be exposed most of the time.
So the airflow requirement will be 600 cfm, which will be more than
adequate for personnel as well.

esiccant dehumidifiers all function the same way — they
remove water from air using the vapor pressure differences
between the air and the desiccant surface to attract and release
moisture. Chapter 3 explained how these vapor pressure differences are
achieved in different types of desiccant dehumidifiers. Now we will
discuss desiccant equipment performance in more depth.
A system designer generally selects equipment based on peak load
requirements, but to fully satisfy all project requirements, it is useful to
understand how performance changes when operating conditions are
different than extreme peak design. This chapter discusses how and
why dehumidifiers perform the way they do, and it explains the
relationships between the key operating variables of the equipment. It
also describes some implications of these relationships — which the
designer may want to consider when engineering a desiccant system.
94
CHAPTER SIX
Operating Variables
There are eight key parameters which affect the performance of desic-
cant dehumidifiers. These include:
1. Process air moisture
2. Process air temperature
3. Process air velocity through the desiccant
4. Reactivation air temperature
5. Reactivation air moisture
6. Reactivation air velocity through the desiccant
7. Amount of desiccant presented to the reactivation and process
airstreams
8. Desiccant sorption-desorption characteristics
The exact effect of each parameter depends on the type of dehumidifier
in question.

8. Desiccant sorption-desorption characteristics
The exact effect of each parameter depends on the type of dehumidifier
in question. To simplify the discussion, we will examine a basic case of
a rotary Honeycombe® dehumidifier, and then comment on differences
with other types of equipment. In our basic example, we will assume
the process air enters at “comfort” conditions —  70°F and 56 gr/lb,
which is near 50% relative humidity.
Figure 6.2 shows what happens to the air on each side of the dehu-
midifier. In our example, the process air leaves the dehumidifier
warmer and drier than when it enters — 109°F and 13 gr/lb. On the
reactivation side, a smaller air volume enters the dehumidifier from the
weather. It passes through a heater and proceeds to the desiccant
wheel. It heats the desiccant, which gives up moisture. The air is
cooled as it absorbs the moisture from the desiccant, leaving the dehu-
midifier very moist, but much cooler than when it entered the desic-
cant wheel.
The operation of a desiccant dehumidifier has been compared to that of
a “humidity pump”. Just like a heat pump moves sensible heat from
one airstream to another, so a desiccant dehumidifier moves latent heat
— moisture — from one airstream to another.

ompared to that of
a “humidity pump”. Just like a heat pump moves sensible heat from
one airstream to another, so a desiccant dehumidifier moves latent heat
— moisture — from one airstream to another. One can also think of a
desiccant dehumidifier as a “moisture concentrator”, since it removes
moisture from the process airstream, and moves it to a much smaller
reactivation airstream, which in effect concentrates the process mois-
ture into the reactivation air.
In discussing dehumidifier performance, we must make one basic as-
sumption at the start — the dehumidifier is operating at equilibrium. In
other words, the total energy on the process side is balanced by the
FIGURE 6.1
Honeycombe® Dehumidifier
performance
Desiccant dehumidifiers remove moisture
from one airstream, called the “ process” air,
and move it to another airstream, called the
“reactivation” air. The amount of moisture
moved depends on the variables shown in
the curves above. High initial moisture in
the process air, high reactivation air
temperature and low process air velocity
combine to remove the largest amount of
moisture from the process air.

DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
energy in reactivation. If the system is not in equilibrium — which can
occur if airflows and temperatures are not controlled — a dehumidifier
will not perform in an easily predictable manner. Assuming equilib-
rium, we will consider how unit performance changes as each key
variable changes from the basic case.

1. Process inlet moisture
First consider the effect of changing the original moisture content of
the air entering on the process side. The effect on outlet moisture is
quite predictable. If the moisture level is lower to start, it will be lower
than 13 gr/lb leaving. For example, air entering at 70°F and 35 gr/lb
will leave at 6 gr/lb.
The temperature of the leaving air will be 101°F instead of 109°F.

evel is lower to start, it will be lower
than 13 gr/lb leaving. For example, air entering at 70°F and 35 gr/lb
will leave at 6 gr/lb.
The temperature of the leaving air will be 101°F instead of 109°F. This
is because the temperature rise of the process air is proportional to the
amount of moisture removed from the air. In the basic example, the
unit removed 42 gr/lb. In the second case, the unit removed only 29
gr/lb, so the air is heated less than in the basic case.
Conversely, if the entering moisture is higher than the base case, the air
will leave the dehumidifier slightly more humid, but also warmer, since
more moisture will have been removed. For example, if air enters at
70°F and 65 gr/lb, it will leave at 113°F and 17 gr/lb. This means 48
gr/lb have been removed from the air, which explains why the air is
warmer than when only 42 gr/lb were removed.
A system designer can consider some implications of inlet moisture
changes:
• If moisture entering is greater than expected, the process air will be
warmer than expected, so if a constant temperature leaving the system
is important, additional cooling will be necessary.
• If moisture is less than expected, the air will leave drier than ex-
pected, so if a constant moisture leaving the system is important, less
air should be processed through the dehumidifier.
2. Process inlet temperature
As described in Chapter 2, desiccant surface vapor pressure depends on
the temperature of the material as well as on its water content.

2. Process inlet temperature
As described in Chapter 2, desiccant surface vapor pressure depends on
the temperature of the material as well as on its water content. So it is
not surprising that desiccant performance is affected by the tempera-
ture of the incoming air. In our basic case, the air temperature is 70°F.
If we lower that to 65°F, the moisture leaving process will be 9 gr/lb
instead of 13 gr/lb. The moisture removal performance is improved
because the desiccant is cooler, and therefore has a lower surface vapor
pressure so it can attract more moisture than in the basic example.
Conversely, if the inlet temperature is increased to 75°F, the air leaving
process is not as dry — 17 gr/lb rather than 13 gr/lb.
The relationship of inlet temperature to performance is clear — when
all other variables are constant, lower inlet temperatures enhance per-
formance and higher temperatures reduce performance.

DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
For a system designer, this relationship has several implications,
including:
• If high temperatures are expected, the engineer needs to confirm
capacity at the highest expected process air temperature, perhaps
selecting a desiccant which may be less temperature-sensitive. Or the
designer can pre-cool the air to assure the desired outlet moisture.
• Cooler than expected process air conditions do not degrade perfor-
mance. This is one reason why desiccant units rather than cooling-
based dehumidifiers are often used in cold-storage areas and spaces
which are not heated in the wintertime.
• The beneficial effect of lower process inlet temperatures is smaller at
very low inlet moisture contents. For instance below 15 gr/lb, the effect
is quite small, so pre-cooling the air from 65° to 55°F may only change
the outlet moisture by 0.1 gr/lb — probably not enough to justify the
investment in the cooling equipment.

the outlet moisture by 0.1 gr/lb — probably not enough to justify the
investment in the cooling equipment.
3. Air velocity through the process side
The slower the air moves through the desiccant bed, the drier the out-
let moisture will be. In our base example, the air travels through the
bed at a velocity of 500 feet per minute, and leaves at a moisture con-
dition of 13 gr/lb. If the velocity is reduced to 400 fpm, the leaving
moisture will be lower — 11.5 gr/lb rather than 13. If the air velocity is
increased to 600 fpm, the leaving air will be more moist — 15 gr/lb
rather than 13. In this example, the difference seems minor, and in-
deed, dehumidifiers are generally selected at the highest velocity that
will accomplish the moisture removal because high velocities mean
smaller, less costly equipment.
However, when air must be delivered at very low conditions, it will be
advantageous to use the lower velocity. For example, if the moisture
control level in the space is 16 gr/lb, the difference between 11.5 and
13 gr/lb supplied to the space represents a 44% difference in the mois-
ture removed from the room. 1000 scfm x 4.5 x [16 – 13] = 13,500 gr/
hr. Compare this to the system’s capacity at 13 gr/lb: 1000 scfm x 4.5 x
[16 – 11.5] = 20,250 gr/hr.

For a designer some implications of changes in process air velocity
include:
• If the outlet moisture must be very low, the process air velocity is
quite critical, and the designer may want to install an airflow monitor-
ing device and control system to avoid unplanned velocity changes.
FIGURE 6.5
Changing process air velocity
Lowering process velocity allows more time
for the air to contact the desiccant, so more
moisture is removed. However, lower
velocities mean larger equipment for a given
airflow, so dehumidifiers are generally
selected at the highest process air velocity
that the application will allow.

• At high inlet moisture levels, the performance difference between low
velocities and high velocities is rather small, so larger equipment may
provide only small improvements in performance.
• If moisture removal rate—pounds removed per hour from the air
stream—is more important than delivered air dewpoint, then high ve-
locities will result in smaller, more economical equipment.

• If moisture removal rate—pounds removed per hour from the air
stream—is more important than delivered air dewpoint, then high ve-
locities will result in smaller, more economical equipment. For ex-
ample, consider an industrial drying process in which moisture
evaporates rapidly from a product, but the air supplied to the product
should not be too dry. A small dehumidifier running high process air
velocities will remove the load quickly, but with less risk of over-drying
than a large unit processing the same amount of air.
4. Air temperature entering reactivation
In a rotary dehumidifier, the desiccant is heated by air entering reacti-
vation. The hotter the desiccant, the more easily it gives up moisture,
so the reactivation air temperature has a strong effect on performance.
Essentially, the drier the desiccant can be made in reactivation, the
more moisture it can absorb when it rotates into the process airstream.
Our basic example assumes the air entering reactivation is at 250°F,
which produces an outlet moisture on the process side of 13 gr/lb. If
the reactivation temperature is reduced to 190°F, the process air outlet
becomes more moist — it leaves the unit at 18 gr/lb instead of 13.
For the system designer, the effect of reactivation temperature suggests:
• If very dry outlet conditions are necessary, plan to use high reactiva-
tion temperatures.
• Desiccant dehumidifiers can make use of even very low temperature
reactivation heat sources.

• If very dry outlet conditions are necessary, plan to use high reactiva-
tion temperatures.
• Desiccant dehumidifiers can make use of even very low temperature
reactivation heat sources. When available, the designer should consider
using economical energy sources like hot water from cogeneration, or
steam condensate. However, the dehumidifier will need to be larger
than one which uses a high-temperature reactivation energy source to
produce the same outlet condition in the process air. In that situation
the designer uses a large unit (lower process air velocities) to achieve
the same effect as high reactivation temperatures. Also, larger reactiva-
tion airflows are necessary because the net energy added for reactiva-
tion (scfm x 1.08 x ∆T) must remain the same to keep the system in
equilibrium. The moisture load from process has not changed. Since
the temperature difference — ∆T — is lower, the airflow — scfm —
must increase.
FIGURE 6.6
Changing reactivation air
temperature
Reducing the temperature of the
reactivation air generally reduces operating
costs, since low-temperature energy is often
less expensive than high-temperature
energy. Sometimes, however, lowering
reactivation temperature results in a larger
dehumidifier, since the process air outlet
moisture is higher than with high-
temperature reactivation.

DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
• Dehumidifiers are often selected at peak summer design conditions,
when air entering the reactivation heaters is quite warm even before it
is heated. During the winter, spring and fall, the air is much cooler.
Since the reactivation air temperature affects dehumidifier perfor-
mance, the designer should check unit capacity at the lower entering
air temperature. It may be necessary to increase reactivation heater
capacity for winter, spring and fall operation if the moisture load on the
process side stays constant between summer and winter. This would be
true of a dehumidifier that dried make-up air downstream of a con-
densing cooling coil. If the load decreases in winter — typical in a stor-
age application with recirculating rather than fresh air — reactivation
energy requirements are also lower, and heaters sized for summer
peaks may be adequate even if the reactivation air starts out much
colder than in summer.

5. Moisture of air entering reactivation
In this example, the desiccant is lithium chloride, which is not espe-
cially sensitive to moisture levels of the entering reactivation air. How-
ever, some mechanical concerns enter the discussion at this point, and
other desiccants like molecular sieves have some sensitivity to reactiva-
tion inlet moisture.
The mechanical concern is air leakage between the moist air entering
reactivation and the dry air leaving the process side of the unit. Any air
leakage from reactivation to process will raise the moisture level in the
process air considerably. For example, assume 500 cfm of process air
normally leaves the unit at 1 gr/lb, but then 20 cfm of moist reactiva-
tion air at 120 gr/lb. leaks into the process airstream. With this addi-
tional moisture, the process air leaves the unit at 5.5 gr/lb — a
considerable performance reduction.
For system designers, this suggests that when using rotary bed, mul-
tiple vertical bed or rotary Honeycombe® desiccant units:
• The manufacturer of the dehumidifier should be consulted concern-
ing the effect of any air leakage between reactivation and process in a
given set of circumstances.

CHAPTER SIX
The performance of some other desiccants, notably molecular sieves
and activated alumina, is considerably more sensitive to moisture in
reactivation air. These desiccants are very useful for adsorbing mois-
ture from warm airstreams. This means they do not lose performance
on the process side when that air is warm, but conversely, such desic-
cants can still adsorb moisture even from warm reactivation air. If the
desiccant partially fills with water in reactivation rather than empties,
it will lose capacity for adsorption from the process air.

s can still adsorb moisture even from warm reactivation air. If the
desiccant partially fills with water in reactivation rather than empties,
it will lose capacity for adsorption from the process air.
For the system designer, this suggests that when using solid
adsorbents:
• If extremely dry process outlet conditions are necessary, it may be
necessary to insure reactivation air is not extremely moist.
• If the reactivation air comes from the weather, relatively high re-
activation temperatures will be necessary for best performance in
summertime.
6. Velocity of air through reactivation
In a rotary dehumidifier, the reactivation air carries heat to the desic-
cant as well as carrying away moisture once it is released by the
desiccant. More air (higher velocity) is necessary for heating than for
carrying away moisture.
It is important to keep the reactivation airflow and temperature in pro-
portion to the moisture load being absorbed by the desiccant on the
process air side. If the moisture loading of the desiccant increases,
more energy must be applied to the desiccant to insure complete reacti-
vation and to keep the system in equilibrium.
The effect of less reactivation air is similar to having a lower reactiva-
tion temperature, because the net heat available to the desiccant is a
function of airflow multiplied by the temperature difference between
the air and the desiccant.

milar to having a lower reactiva-
tion temperature, because the net heat available to the desiccant is a
function of airflow multiplied by the temperature difference between
the air and the desiccant. In other words, high temperatures and high
reactivation airflows deliver more heat to the desiccant, which means it
can absorb more moisture in process because the material has been
more completely dried in reactivation.
However, if the temperature entering reactivation stays constant and
airflow is increased beyond the minimum necessary to carry the heat to
the desiccant, the energy will simply be wasted. Unless there is an
increase in the moisture to be removed from the desiccant, the reactiva-
tion air leaves the dehumidifier warmer than necessary, carrying heat
off to the weather.
101
DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
Implications for the system designer include:
• Rough filtration of reactivation air is always necessary. The designer
should insure that changing or cleaning these filters is an easy and
obvious task for maintenance personnel to accomplish. Otherwise, the
filters will eventually clog, reducing airflow, which reduces perfor-
mance.
• Reactivation airflow should be properly controlled to avoid higher
than expected air velocities through the desiccant — fixed or modulat-
ing airflow dampers usually suffice.
• Mechanical considerations limit the practical number of choices for
fans and heaters.

gher
than expected air velocities through the desiccant — fixed or modulat-
ing airflow dampers usually suffice.
• Mechanical considerations limit the practical number of choices for
fans and heaters. However, the operational range necessary in reactiva-
tion may be very broad because of wide seasonal variations in process
air moisture load. The designer must size for the maximum load, but
recognize that the heater and fan selections will be less than optimum
at part-load conditions unless the owner is willing to invest in modulat-
ing controls.
There are other implications for the designer that depend on the type of
desiccant used in the unit, for instance:
• In the basic example, the dehumidifier uses lithium chloride. When it
is a liquid, the desiccant has capacity to absorb hundreds of times its
own weight in water vapor, which has many advantages. However,
when lithium chloride is used in a rotating dehumidifier, it must be
well-reactivated — dried out — otherwise it may absorb too much wa-
ter and migrate through the support structure. So complete reactivation
— which means maintaining heat and airflow to the reactivation sector
— is especially important any time the machine is absorbing moisture
on the process side.
• Granular desiccants like molecular sieves and silica gel are often used
in packed tower, rotating tray or multiple vertical bed dehumidifiers.

• Granular desiccants like molecular sieves and silica gel are often used

Higher than expected air velocities in either process or reactivation in
these units can “fluidize” the desiccant — the air lifts it, and the desic-
cant bounces, which leads to air leakage through the bed and desiccant
powdering. Both problems affect performance, so airflows should be
controlled to avoid them.
• In liquid desiccant dehumidifiers, excessive air velocities can pull
droplets of desiccant into the air. In reactivation, this can lead to corro-
sion of ductwork, and on the process side, the desiccant may not be
useful to have in the conditioned space. As in all other types of dehu-
midifiers, airflow through liquid units should be controlled to avoid
potential difficulties.

CHAPTER SIX
7. Amount of desiccant presented to the airstream
Along with other factors, the amount of moisture removed from the air
depends on how much desiccant the air contacts as it moves through
the dehumidifier — more desiccant means more moisture removed. In
a rotary Honeycombe® dehumidifier, there are two ways to present
more desiccant to the air — make the wheel deeper, or turn it faster.
Either strategy will remove more moisture from the air, but both have
an additional energy cost.
Increasing the depth of the wheel increases the resistance to air flowing
through the unit.

 it faster.
Either strategy will remove more moisture from the air, but both have
an additional energy cost.
Increasing the depth of the wheel increases the resistance to air flowing
through the unit. More surface area in contact with the air means more
air friction. In the case of rotary tray, packed towers or multiple vertical
beds, the desiccant is granular, so the flow is turbulent. This means the
resistance to airflow essentially increases as the square of the air veloc-
ity. Liquid systems are similar — the airflow is turbulent through the
conditioner and regenerator. Resistance — therefore fan energy — be-
comes very high very quickly in deep beds.
In the case of Honeycombe® dehumidifiers, the effect is somewhat less.
Airflow through the straight passages is laminar rather than turbulent,
but resistance still increases in proportion to wheel depth. So in all
cases, increasing bed depth also increases fan energy costs.
Desiccant exposure to the airstream can also be increased by turning
the wheel or bed faster between process and reactivation for solid des-
iccant units, or by pumping a desiccant solution more quickly between
the conditioner and regenerator in liquid desiccant dehumidifiers. In
many cases, this can increase unit capacity, but again — like deeper
beds — the extra capacity increases energy consumption out of propor-
tion to the extra water removed.

 desiccant dehumidifiers. In
many cases, this can increase unit capacity, but again — like deeper
beds — the extra capacity increases energy consumption out of propor-
tion to the extra water removed.
When the desiccant returns to the process air after reactivation, it
brings heat from the reactivation process. The amount of heat is di-
rectly proportional to the mass of the desiccant and the temperature
difference between the warm desiccant and the cooler process air. So
when more desiccant cycles between process and reactivation, more
heat is carried over into process, where energy will often have to be
invested to cool the desiccant and the process air. Note that increasing
bed depth also has the effect of moving more mass between process
and reactivation, which will call for more cooling in process as well.

DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
In general, manufacturers are keenly aware of these trade-offs, and
units are designed to optimize the relationship between energy and
capacity. The system designer does not usually have to determine
bed depths or circulation rates — they will be established by the
manufacturer.
8. Desiccant sorption and desorption characteristics
Each desiccant has unique sorption characteristics which affect the
performance of the dehumidifier.

8. Desiccant sorption and desorption characteristics
Each desiccant has unique sorption characteristics which affect the
performance of the dehumidifier. These characteristics can be shown
graphically as a capacity isotherm, which indicates how moisture ca-
pacity changes as a function of relative humidity when both desiccant
and air are at the same temperature.
Figure 6.8 shows the capacity of four desiccants at 77°F. Capacity is
expressed as the weight of water retained as a percent of the dry
weight of the material. For instance, at 20% relative humidity, Type 5
silica gel can hold 2.5% of its dry weight in water, Type 1 gel holds
15%, molecular sieve holds 20% and lithium chloride holds 35%. So if
the dehumidification process was purely isothermal, and if the dehu-
midifier had to remove 50 lbs of water vapor from an airstream at 20%
relative humidity, then the unit would have to contain at least the
amounts of desiccant shown in figure 6.8.
Amounts of desiccant in dehumidifiers are not determined this way
because the problem is considerably more complex. For instance, the
quantities in the table would absorb the moisture if enough time were
allowed for all the desiccant to come into equilibrium with the air —
but that would take too long. Much more desiccant is necessary to
remove a pound of water from a fast-moving airstream.

actual dehumidifier, the sorption process is not in any sense isothermal
— the desiccant and air temperature and moisture content change con-
stantly as air moves across the desiccant surface. But a desiccant iso-
therm does serve to illustrate why different desiccants are sometimes
used in some applications and not in others.
For instance, molecular sieves are often used in drying air to very low
dewpoints. Looking at the isotherm, it is clear that molecular sieves
have a larger capacity than others when air is below 10%rh, so less
desiccant will be necessary to remove a given weight of water.

of water above 90%rh.
As with desiccant bed depth and cycling rate, desiccant selection and
amount used in a given situation are generally accomplished by the
manufacturer rather than by the system designer. Desiccant behavior is
much more complex than a single isotherm, particularly when one
considers that the desorption characteristics in reactivation are equally
as important to unit performance as sorption from the process air. The
behavior of combinations of desiccants are even more complex, and
many manufacturers use such combinations to gain competitive advan-
tages in particular applications.
FIGURE 6.8
Desiccant capacity
At constant temperature, each desiccant
has a fixed capacity to absorb moisture. Its
capacity is a function of relative humidity.
The table shows one consequence of that
fact. To collect a fixed weight of water
vapor, the weight of desiccant necessary
varies according to the sorption
characteristics of each material.

DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER PERFORMANCE
Of more immediate concern to a system designer is the performance of
a given desiccant or desiccant combination over time — what is the
effect on performance of thermal cycling and airstream contaminants
like particles and gases.
In general, desiccants are selected precisely because they are thermally
durable and resistant to the effects of contamination, but each desic-
cant has some characteristics that have implications for the system
designer:
• Solid adsorbents like silica gel and molecular sieves collect water on
their surface and in narrow crevices of each particle. If the crevices are
filled with dust, there will be less room for water, and performance will
slowly diminish each year as particle loading increases.
• Organic vapors are often adsorbed by solid desiccants as efficiently as
water, and indeed, some desiccant units are used specifically to remove
such contamination from indoor air. However, some materials can poly-
merize when subjected to the high heat of reactivation, which may
eventually clog the pores or modify desiccant surface characteristics.
• Liquid absorbents like lithium chloride and triethylene glycol collect
water through a chemical reaction.

activation, which may
eventually clog the pores or modify desiccant surface characteristics.
• Liquid absorbents like lithium chloride and triethylene glycol collect
water through a chemical reaction. The presence of other chemicals in
the airstream can interfere with the reaction, or change the desiccant
chemically. For instance, heavy airstream contamination by sulfur tri-
oxide can — over a period of years — convert lithium chloride to
lithium sulfate, which is not an effective desiccant.
• All desiccants, liquid or solid, can emit small particles into the air
when air velocities are high, or as thermal cycling eventually fragments
a desiccant. Again, the process takes years of continuous operation,
and the amounts are very small — on the order of one part in 10,000 of
the mass of the desiccant in a year.
The implications for the system designer are simple — always filter the
air entering a desiccant dehumidifier. Consider filtering the air leaving
the unit if minute amounts of particulate would be harmful down-
stream, and consult with the manufacturer if the designer expects large
amounts of vapors other than water in the system.

esiccant dehumidification systems vary in size, cost and com-
plexity, but they generally fall into five basic types according to
their application:
• Passive storage
Passive storage includes any storage environment where a controlled
space is not frequently opened or closed, such as the storage of mu-
seum material, or the protection of military and industrial equipment.
• Active storage
These applications have more door activity, with higher intermittent
temperature and humidity loads than static applications. Examples
include steel storage warehouses, fertilizer warehouses and cold stor-
age facilities.
• Commercial and institutional HVAC systems
Such systems have a need to combine comfort-level temperature con-
trol for people with low-level humidity control for products and pro-
cesses. Supermarkets, hotels, medical facilities and laboratories are
typical of this category. Such systems can have a comparatively low
sensible heat load ratio (SHR), so dehumidification is a concern.
• Industrial HVAC systems
Many industrial processes benefit greatly from close control of tempera-
ture and humidity. Such applications typically have very tight toler-
ances and must function 24 hours, 7 days a week.

 systems
Many industrial processes benefit greatly from close control of tempera-
ture and humidity. Such applications typically have very tight toler-
ances and must function 24 hours, 7 days a week. These demanding
requirements call for heavy-duty equipment with plenty of extra capac-
ity. Applications include hundreds of high-value-added processes
where product quality and high-speed production are the primary con-
cerns.
• Product drying systems
In these applications, the dehumidification system is designed to re-
move moisture from materials rather than maintain a constant humid-
ity level in a room or building. Pharmaceutical products, coated candy,
photographic film, fish and plastic resins are all dried with desiccant
systems. Water-damaged buildings and materials are also dried by ser-
vice companies which bring free-standing dehumidifiers to an object or
room which must be dried quickly. These applications are all similar in
that maintaining high temperature and air velocity are not enough to
accomplish the drying fast enough or without heat damage to the
product, so dehumidification of the drying air becomes economically
advantageous.

For maximum efficiency, the designer must clearly understand the
project purpose. This quickly sorts all the various design issues in order
of their relative importance.
For example, if the purpose of a project is to prevent the growth of
mold on corn, there is no need to maintain a strict tolerance of ± 1%
relative humidity throughout the storage bin. The only real concern is
that the humidity does not exceed 60% and that condensation does not
occur. The control system can be quite simple, and the equipment is
small and economical.
On the other hand, if the purpose of the system is to prevent the corro-
sion of lithium, there is no point in trying to save money by using a
control which has a tolerance of ± 5% relative humidity. Above 2%
relative humidity, lithium corrodes giving off hydrogen, which eventu-
ally explodes. A control with a tolerance larger than the control level
itself cannot hope to start the dehumidification system in time to pre-
vent that explosion. Understanding the project purpose helps the de-
signer avoid unnecessary expense and false economy in both design
time and equipment cost.
Additionally, the best dehumidification system designs are laid out with
one thought firmly in mind — the system is dynamic, and no single
component performs in isolation. Changes in any aspect of the system
affect all other aspects.

cation system designs are laid out with
one thought firmly in mind — the system is dynamic, and no single
component performs in isolation. Changes in any aspect of the system
affect all other aspects. This is useful to remember because designers
often concentrate on the mechanical aspects of the project, neglecting
architectural and management issues that determine the sensible heat
and moisture loads on the system.
With a clear understanding of the project purpose and a good under-
standing of how the system relates to its surroundings, the designer will
understand the “big picture”, and he can then proceed to lay out the
system using the sequence illustrated by the examples which follow.
Any project needs a clearly stated purpose
to avoid confusion and to guide design
decisions. For example, several years ago,
a military storage warehouse was built
with a system specification requiring a
maximum 40% relative humidity.
Although the design accomplished that
specification, the real purpose of the
building was to prevent corrosion of
munitions, and in that, the project failed.
The sheet steel roof cooled rapidly at
night, causing water to condense on the
ceiling even though the humidity was
below 40% inside the building. The
condensed water dripped on the
munitions, which of course rusted badly.
If the purpose of the project was more
explicit, the designer might have looked
beyond the 40% condition to other
possible corrosion mechanisms such as
condensation.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Passive storage - Museum example
The adjective “passive” is a relative term. In this case, we use it to
distinguish between systems which have large transient loads and
those which do not. For example, a photographic film archive is a rela-
tively “passive” storage application if no one works in the room. In
contrast, we consider an ice cream warehouse to be “active” because
fork lift trucks move product in and out all day long, creating large
transient heat and moisture loads.
Passive storage systems tend to be the simplest dehumidification sys-
tems. The loads are small and the tolerances are often wide. There is
generally no benefit to complex central air handling systems unless the
facility is quite large. System design often consists of placing the cor-
rect size dehumidifier in the room, ducting the reactivation air in and
out and placing the humidistat in a location with good air circulation.
In our first example, consider a small room in the basement of a mu-
seum that will be used to store motion pictures and still photographs.

ne —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to prevent the fading of organic dyes used
in the color film, and to prevent damage from mold formation on nega-
tives and prints. The museum has recently acquired this significant
collection with the stipulation that suitable archival conditions be pro-
vided. However, there is no room in the upstairs air-conditioned offices,
and previous experience with storage in the cool basement was unfor-
tunate. Nearly all the negatives had developed mold within a matter of
months because of the high humidity. With a small budget, the curator
is attempting to provide the best possible facility for the lowest possible
cost.
FIGURE 7.1
Dehumidified storage installations can be
very simple and economical. The chief
requirement is an enclosure which does not
leak air.
In this example, the room is standard
drywall construction, but it could just as
easily be a frame of 2 x 4" studding covered
with plastic film as long as all joints are
sealed with aluminum foil vapor-retarder
tape. The important point is that the vapor-
retarder film must be continuous, so that
moist air cannot leak into the enclosure.
Floors must be sealed with epoxy floor
paint, and ceilings must also have a
continuous film of paint or vapor-retarder
film. Ceiling tiles in a grid frame are not
sufficient.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Step Two —  Establishing control levels and tolerances
The best information available from photo film manufacturers suggests
the optimum condition for the storage of color film is 0°F and 35%
relative humidity. At those conditions, color images should last indefi-
nitely — perhaps longer than 500 years. (See references) Unfortunately,
the budget will not accommodate such a facility. Also, when material is
kept at such low temperatures, it must be brought into a special “dry
warming room” for several hours before it can be exposed to normal
room conditions. If it was brought into the working areas of the mu-
seum from a temperature of 0°F, it would condense water from the air
like a cold beer can in summer, causing major damage to the images.
So, for a ten-fold reduction in the project cost, and to simplify access to
the material, the curator determines that the humidity should be kept
between 30 and 40% RH, and the temperature between 55 and 70°F.
Current research suggests this will preserve the images for at least 50
years, and certainly will prevent any extreme damage.

Step Three —  Calculate heat and moisture loads
Rather than trying to condition the whole basement with its ancient
mortarless-fieldstone foundation and rammed-earth floor, the designer
suggests the construction of a free-standing room. This improves both
the security and cleanliness of the collection and simplifies environ-
mental control.
The room measures 20' x 30' x 10' high. It has a single door, but no
windows. The walls and ceiling are simple 3/8" drywall-on-stud con-
struction, with taped and sanded joints and two coats of latex-based
vapor retarder paint. The floor is poured concrete, painted with epoxy
floor paint. In short — simple, residential-grade room construction.
This is adequate, as long as close attention is paid to taping and sealing
joints where walls meet the ceiling and floor. Since the room is in the
basement, it is not exposed to the weather, so there is no need for more
durable construction.
If it is important to maintain a higher minimum temperature in the
room, a layer of 4" fiberglass insulation is a simple and cost-effective
addition to the specifications. But in this case, cooler is better, and
since the basement never gets below 55°F even in the winter, there is
no need for either supplemental heat or insulation.

111
SYSTEM DESIGN
During the summer, the basement temperature can go to 80°F, so there
will be a need for supplemental cooling. Heat load calculations deter-
mine that even without wall insulation, the load through the ceiling
and walls will be only 400 BTUs per hour. The moisture load is also
very small — it consists of the diffusion through the walls, ceiling and
floor, some air leakage around the door frame, and the air exchange
that results from people occasionally opening the door. In this case, the
curator does not expect the door will be opened more than once or
twice a day since the collection is not active.

Step Four —  Size the components to remove the loads
The cooling system must be able to remove 400 BTUs per hour from a
room held at 70°F. This is well within the capacity of even the smallest
window air conditioners sold for residential applications. Such a unit
can be easily mounted through the room wall, with the condenser sec-
tion rejecting heat from the room to the surrounding basement. How-
ever, the designer needs to be aware that these units often have an
outside air intake for ventilation.

all, with the condenser sec-
tion rejecting heat from the room to the surrounding basement. How-
ever, the designer needs to be aware that these units often have an
outside air intake for ventilation. Sometimes this can be sealed by a
switch so air recirculates in the room, but other times the intake must
be sealed with aluminum foil tape to prevent its becoming a leakage
path for moisture.
The dehumidifier must be capable of removing at least 2100 grains of
water vapor per hour from any condition between 55 and 70°F at 35%
relative humidity. This is still easily within the capacity of a very small
desiccant dehumidifier. Since both the dehumidifier and cooler have
more capacity than required, they will operate intermittently, turning
on when the control sensors call for cooler and drier conditions.
FIGURE 7.2
A detailed moisture load calculation
performed as outlined in Chapter five shows
that the hourly moisture load is quite small,
totalling only 2092 grains per hour. This is
less than 0.5 lb of water. The crack around
the door is the largest load. A gasket would
reduce this to almost zero.
The load from people and door openings is
calculated by taking the single person and
two openings per day and dividing the load
these represent by eight hours to arrive at an
average hourly load. A more conservative
calculation would include the entire load in
a single hour —  which is the way the load
actually occurs.

these represent by eight hours to arrive at an

actually occurs. However, since the stored
product is not really sensitive to occasional
minor excursions from the control point, the
designer chooses the less conservative
calculation method. This saves money, but
the curator must recognize that the room
may need some time to “ pull down”
following high door activity, since the
dehumidifier will not be sized to remove the
entire load immediately.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Step Five —  Select the control system
In this case, one of the goals is to maintain a constant condition. But
with such small, simple components, the control system is on-off — no
smooth capacity modulation is easily achieved. As the units switch on,
they make fast changes in the air because their capacity is large com-
pared to the load.
This can be further aggravated by the congestion present in a typical
store room. Stacks of documents and shelving restrict airflow, so unless
steps are taken to circulate the air through the whole room, the units
can over-cool and over-dry one part of the room while other parts are
above the desired control point.
The solution to both of these problems need not be costly. The de-
signer can call for simple, propeller-type circulation fans to hang on the
walls or ceiling and to operate continuously.

areas around the thermostat and humidistat. These controls should be
located well out of the airstreams coming directly from the dehumidi-
fier and air conditioner — otherwise they will turn off the machines
before the entire space is dry and cool.
If the humidity and temperature are indicated through dials or recorded
on charts, it is best to locate the instruments near the humidistat and
thermostat. No two sensors read precisely the same, but co-locating the
recorder and controller sensors minimizes confusion.
Other considerations
Sometimes, air distribution and uniformity is a larger issue, for in-
stance in long, narrow rooms or in rooms which are L-shaped or Z-
shaped in plan. One approach, used very successfully in large steel
warehouses, is to use several small dehumidifiers rather than one
larger one, and place them throughout the room, each responding to a
local humidistat.
Another approach is to replace the propeller fans with a simple ducted
air distribution system which discharges air on one side of the room
and collects it along the opposite wall, operating continuously like the
propeller fans.

SYSTEM DESIGN
When storage systems are started up, they sometimes run more often
than expected, and with apparently little effect on the room humidity at
first. Then slowly the room condition comes into specification. This will
happen whenever there is a large amount of absorbed moisture in either
the materials of construction or in the material stored in the room.

lowly the room condition comes into specification. This will
happen whenever there is a large amount of absorbed moisture in either
the materials of construction or in the material stored in the room.
For example, the equilibrium moisture content of typical corrugated
board is 14% at 80% relative humidity and 6% at 35% rh. So if papers
and cartons are stored in a high humidity basement and then transferred
to the archive in this example, they would eventually give up 8% of
their weight to the air in the form of water vapor. A 30' x 20' room
could easily hold 3,000 lbs of paper and film, which means the dehu-
midifier must remove 240 lbs of water from the material until it reaches
equilibrium with the dry air in the archive. This may take several days,
and in the meantime, the room humidity may be above specification.
Good air circulation through the room and around the shelves will
speed the drying process, but in most cases, archival materials do not
profit from rapid changes in moisture content. With sensitive materials
that have a high initial moisture content, it may be best to gradually
reduce the room humidity over a period of several days or even weeks,
avoiding any product damage due to sudden drying.

Passive Storage - Military Example
Another form of passive storage system is widely used to protect mili-

instruments, electronics and precision-machined surfaces which can be
damaged by high humidity or condensation.
Step One —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to prevent corrosion damage without the
cost, time delay and difficulty of preserving the material with greases
and other chemicals because the equipment needs to be ready for in-
stant use. The project has come about because a military unit has had
difficulty maintaining their tanks in fully mission-capable condition.
Electronic failures have created major combat-readiness issues. The
cost of instrument recalibration is very high, and more importantly,
very few skilled technicians are available to accomplish recalibration.
Although such equipment is normally stored in humidity-controlled
warehouses, there has been a shortfall in the military construction
budget, and no warehouse space is available. We will suppose a project
officer has been assigned to design and install a desiccant wheel
(DEW) dry air protection system.
Step Two —  Establishing control levels and tolerances
Technical references dealing with atmospheric corrosion explain that
ferrous metals corrode at slow and constant rates below 50% relative
humidity, and at accelerating rates above that point. (See references)
However, in this case, the more important concern is preventing corro-
sion of electrical contacts.

tant rates below 50% relative
humidity, and at accelerating rates above that point. (See references)
However, in this case, the more important concern is preventing corro-
sion of electrical contacts. These are made of copper alloys and are
more sensitive to corrosion than plates of ferrous metal. The contact
joints often connect two dissimilar metals or alloys, which makes the
FIGURE 7.6
Industrial and military equipment is often
more sensitive to humidity damage than to
high or low temperatures. Although such
equipment is often designed to be
weathertight, it is not usually airtight.
In this case, the tanks have so many air leak
points that it is more practical to enclose
them in flexible fabric covers than to cover
all the holes with foil tape. Air is then
recirculated through these “ bags” by a
desiccant dehumidifier.

SYSTEM DESIGN
joint electrochemically more active. Also, it takes very little corrosion
to cause problems because there is very little material in the joint. An
increase in electrical resistance at a corroded contact causes problems
even before the corrosion is visible to the naked eye.
Assuming normal atmospheric concentrations of sulfur dioxide and
trioxide, technical references suggest the corrosion rate of copper is cut
in half when the relative humidity moves from 80% to 60% relative
humidity, and reduced to 10% of the normal rate when humidity is
controlled at 30%.

rences suggest the corrosion rate of copper is cut
in half when the relative humidity moves from 80% to 60% relative
humidity, and reduced to 10% of the normal rate when humidity is
controlled at 30%. With that in mind, the project officer decides to set
the control level at 35% relative humidity, with a tolerance of ± 5% rh.
Since the equipment is not temperature-sensitive, there is no need to
heat or cool the tanks while in storage.
Step Three —  Calculate moisture loads
The tanks will be kept in protective bags made of heavy-duty vinyl
fabric. The project officer designs what is commonly known as a
“closed”, or “recirculated” dehumidification system. Air is drawn from
the bags through the dehumidifier and supplied back to the bags
around the tanks.
There is a small amount of air leakage at the seams, and around the
joints where air distribution piping meets the fabric. There is also a
minute amount of leakage through the vinyl fabric itself — it is not a
perfect vapor barrier. Apart from this minor infiltration and transmis-
sion, there are no moisture loads. No doors are open, no moist materi-
als flow in and out of the tanks and no people breathe out moisture
inside the enclosures. Also, there is no need for fresh air.

there is no hazard. In the case of more volatile fuels — for instance jet
fuel for aircraft — the system could be arranged to bring fresh air from
the weather to push the vapors out of the covers through relief valves.
In that “open” type of system, the moisture load in the fresh air would
be quite large in comparison to this small load in the closed system.
 Step Four —  Size the equipment to remove the loads
There is no cooling or heating requirement in this application, so that
type of equipment is not necessary.

o this small load in the closed system.
 Step Four —  Size the equipment to remove the loads
There is no cooling or heating requirement in this application, so that
type of equipment is not necessary. The moisture load in the four tank
enclosures totals less than one pound of water vapor per hour, so the
dehumidifier could theoretically be quite small. However, there are two
other issues in this case — having enough dry air capacity to reduce
the humidity in response to rapid weather changes, and having enough
fan capacity to force air through the system.
To visualize the first concern, assume that air in the system is at a con-
dition of 80°F and 35% relative humidity. Therefore the specific hu-
midity is 55 grains of water vapor per pound of air. Then the weather
changes as a cold front moves through the area, and the air inside the
enclosure cools to 40°. The original 55 grain moisture would now cre-
ate a condition of 100% rh, so the dehumidifier must switch on and
rapidly dry the enclosure.
Another form of this problem occurs when the weather temperature
rises rapidly on a spring or fall morning. The air in the enclosure starts
out at 40°F and 35% rh. The metal surfaces in the tank are also at 40°.
Then the air around the tanks warms up to 80°. The humidistat is
sensing the rh of the air, not the metal surface, so it does not turn on
the dehumidifier until the relative humidity goes above 35%.

Then the air around the tanks warms up to 80°. The humidistat is
sensing the rh of the air, not the metal surface, so it does not turn on
the dehumidifier until the relative humidity goes above 35%. Since the
metal surfaces are still cold — particularly those inside the tank — they
condense moisture because 35% rh at 80°F is above a 40° dewpoint.
To avoid both of these problems, the dehumidifier must have the ca-
pacity to dry all the air in the system very rapidly. The project officer
decides the dehumidifier must be large enough to dry all the air within
a half hour. The decision is based on the fact that the tanks are ex-
posed to the weather. They are not inside a large warehouse — which
would slow down the effect of weather changes. In fact, in sealed
warehouses, the dehumidifier capacity specified by U.S. Army guide-
lines only needs to dry the air once every four hours.
So, since there are four tanks to dry, and each has an enclosed volume
of roughly 510 cubic feet, the total air volume is 2040 cubic feet. The
air in the ductwork totals 60 cubic feet. If that must be dried in half an

if a weather front moves through —  cooling
the air to 40° — the dehumidifier must
quickly dry the air, because 55 gr/lb is more
than 100% relative humidity at 40° .

The dehumidifier must have the capacity to
remove the basic moisture load, but if the
temperature can change rapidly, the unit
must have enough capacity to dry the
enclosure as fast as the temperature change
occurs. This can be expressed in air changes
per unit time. In this case, the project
engineer wants one air change within a half
hour.

hour, the dehumidifier must process 70 cfm. (2100 cubic feet divided by
30 minutes equals 70 cubic feet per minute) The dehumidifier is still
quite small.
Small dehumidifiers are not normally equipped with fans powerful
enough to push through long runs of ductwork. The project officer
consults Chapter 32 of the ASHRAE Handbook— Fundamentals, and
concludes that if the air is flowing through 4" PVC pipe to all of the
tanks, the pressure loss due to air friction will be less than 1.5 inches
water column.
A small fan is added to the system downstream of the dehumidifier to
blow the air into the tanks. The fan actually has a capacity of 2.0"WC
at 70 cfm, so it is important to add some form of airflow control. If
there is no control, the fan pulls 125 cfm, which is its capacity at 1.5"
of air pressure.

there is no control, the fan pulls 125 cfm, which is its capacity at 1.5"
of air pressure.
Step Five —  Select the control system
The system must control the amount of air pulled by the fan, and the
humidity level inside the tanks.
Airflow control is very simple. Since there is no need for the airflow to
vary, a sliding plate is placed on the inlet to the dehumidifier, and its
position is fixed with a screw. Such sliding plates are standard air-con-
ditioning duct fittings.
Humidity control is slightly more complex. A humidistat is placed in-
side each tank, and all four units are wired in parallel, so that a rise in
humidity above 35% in any of the tanks will switch on the dehumidi-
fier and booster fan. The important decision is the location of the hu-
midistat within the tank.
Even though the tank is a relatively small space, the relative humidity
can vary inside because of differences in air temperature, and proximity
to small air leaks from the weather. The appropriate location for the
humidistat is close to the electronics, since protecting them is the prin-
cipal purpose of the project.
To be sure there will not be a problem with condensation on cold sur-
faces even when the relative humidity is 35%, the project officer in-
vests in a second set of controls for each tank. A dewpoint controller is
fastened to the chassis of the sensitive electronics.

vests in a second set of controls for each tank. A dewpoint controller is
fastened to the chassis of the sensitive electronics. This device mea-
sures the relative humidity at the surface of the metal rather than the
air. If there is any danger of condensation, the controller will turn on
the system to dry out the tanks.
In a system consisting of bags and
ductwork, the moisture loads are very
small. In old, large buildings, there is
often a question as to how best to seal the
building to make it vapor-tight.
Sometimes a designer can be overly-
concerned with hermeticity. In moderate
humidity-control ranges —  40 to 60% rh
— the issue is not as critical as at lower
control conditions.
The largest moisture load comes from
infiltration air, which leaks in through
large holes in the wall. These can be fixed
with plastic film stapled in place, with
edges sealed with aluminum foil tape. It is
not necessary to weld up all the cracks in
the building. Air leaks are the problem,
not vapor transmission.
One project in a steel warehouse was held
up for two years because it would have
cost $250,000 to caulk or replace leaking
steel siding. The project finally went
ahead with simple plywood covers over
old ventilator louvres, and it only required
a slightly larger dehumidifier to maintain
control. The additional cost of the larger
dehumidifier was less than 5% of the cost
of replacing the steel siding.

In another case, the engineer simply built
a frame of 2" x 4" studding covered with
clear plastic sheeting inside an older, leaky
building. The equipment was protected
from the weather by the large building.
Water vapor was controlled by a very
small unit which dehumidified only the
plastic “room”.
118
CHAPTER SEVEN
Other considerations
Air distribution
Since the goal of the project is to protect the instruments in the tank
interior, it makes sense to carry the dry air to the tank interior rather
than just into its cover. A flexible hose directs the dry air into the bot-
tom of the tank, and moist air is forced out of the tank into the sur-
rounding cover. From the cover, moist air is returned to the
dehumidifier.
Tank security
Since the system is closed, the dehumidifier will not run very often. If
it does turn on frequently, there is probably a leak in the enclosure,
which could mean the tanks are insecure. Some installations are moni-
tored so security personnel can be alerted if the dehumidifier runs for
long periods.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Active Storage - Refrigerated Warehouse Example
Active applications differ from passive storage in that moisture and
heat loads are periodically very high. They are similar to passive stor-
age because there is often no need for extreme precision, and the tem-
perature requirement is either modest or dealt with by other building
heating and cooling systems.
Since the moisture loads are quite different from those of a passive
storage application, the system is designed in a different way as well.
The designer’s principal concern is to minimize loads without interfer-
ing with the main functions of the storage facility. For our example, we
will examine a contract warehouse which stores ice cream and candy.
Step One —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to eliminate wet floors and ice build-up
on walls, floors and equipment. These are safety issues. Slips, falls and
collisions are the leading causes of worker’s compensation claims
against refrigerated warehouses. The general manager intends to im-
prove conditions by installing desiccant dehumidifiers to reduce the
icing that causes such costly accidents.

Refrigerated warehouses are a typical
dynamic storage application. The principal
moisture loads come from doors opening as

The warehouse manager has no decision to make on temperature —
the storage contracts are clear on this point. The manufacturers that
rent warehouse space specify ice cream storage at -10°F and candy
storage at 50°F. Humidity control levels require more thought. What
conditions will meet the project goals — no condensation and no mois-
ture absorption by cardboard?
Condensation and frost will not occur if the air dewpoint is below the
inside surface temperature of the walls, floor and equipment. The man-
ager obtains a low-cost infrared surface temperature thermometer, and
measures each surface with these results:

The lowest dewpoint in the building is the -20°F condition on the
evaporator coils for the ice cream room. But the cooling system is
equipped with an effective automatic defrost system, so while coil
frosting is an energy consumer, it does not interfere with normal
operation of the warehouse. The real concern is icing on conveyors and
floors, which is a significant problem in normal operation because it
must be removed by hand.
The manager decides to set the dewpoint control level in the ice cream
room at -10°F. This will prevent icing on the conveyors, but some ice
will still accumulate on the evaporator coils. This is an economic deci-
sion — it is less expensive to dehumidify to -10° than to -20°, and the
rate of accumulation will still be much less at a -10° dewpoint than it
has been with uncontrolled humidity. Also, the manager reasons that

SYSTEM DESIGN
the system design can be arranged to place the driest air on the coldest
surfaces. While the dewpoint in the room is controlled at -10°, the air
supplied from the dehumidifier direct to the evaporators, floor and
conveyor will be much lower, reducing frosting.
In the candy area, moisture absorption will occur in direct proportion
to the relative humidity around the cartons. The carton manufacturer
confirms that the cartons will retain 80% of their design strength if
kept in a 50% relative humidity condition. Also, the candy manufac-
turer prefers a maximum 50% relative humidity to preserve product
freshness. (See references) So the relative humidity is set at 50% in the
candy storage area. Lower might be better, but would also be more
expensive in terms of dehumidification equipment and operating cost.
The dewpoint at 50°F and 50% rh is 33°F. This is well below the sur-
face temperature of both the evaporator coil and the floor — so there is
no condensation in the candy room at this control level. This level will
achieve three desirable goals: preventing softening of cartons, eliminat-
ing condensation on surfaces and even improving the operating effi-
ciency of the refrigeration system by reducing coil frosting.
In the loading dock area, the manager chooses to control at a +33°F
dewpoint.

In the loading dock area, the manager chooses to control at a +33°F
dewpoint. The logic is similar to that used in the ice cream room — it
would be very costly to control the whole loading dock to a 0°F
dewpoint just to eliminate all frost on the ice cream conveyor. A +33°
dewpoint will eliminate the major problem of wet floors, and the air
distribution system can be designed to put the driest air near the con-
veyor and the freezer door. This will reduce if not completely eliminate
conveyor icing at less cost than controlling the whole dock at a low
dewpoint.
Step Three —  Calculate heat and moisture loads
Heat loads are handled quite well by the existing refrigeration system.
One important point concerning heat loads is that the desiccant dehu-
midifiers convert latent heat to sensible heat as they dry the air. After
the dehumidifiers are selected and their performance is determined, the
refrigeration system capacity should be checked to ensure it can re-
move this sensible heat load.
The designer employed by the warehouse manager begins her moisture
load calculation with the loading dock area. Since the dock is the most
open to the weather, the loads will be highest at this point. High loads
should be carefully examined since they lead to high costs.
122
CHAPTER SEVEN
The first moisture load calculation illustrates this point.

CHAPTER SEVEN
The first moisture load calculation illustrates this point. The internal
load is very large — 297 lbs of water vapor per hour. Removing this
amount of moisture from a space held at 28 grains per lb would require
over 20,000 cfm of dry air. That would mean a rather large dehumidi-
fier, certainly larger than the budget allows.

Now the manager has two choices — reduce the load or raise the con-
trol level. Raising the control level defeats the purpose of the project. If
the dewpoint is above the surface temperature of the floors and walls,
water will continue to condense and cause problems. The manager and
designer re-examine the loads.
The largest load — door openings — is the right place to start. The
manager knows that an average of 15 trucks per hour pull out of the
warehouse, leaving the loading doors uncovered. He also knows the
workers do not quickly close the steel rolling doors over the openings.
The designer’s calculations assume an open door for three minutes
each opening — two minutes after the truck pulls out and one minute
when the truck pulls in.

The designer’s calculations assume an open door for three minutes
each opening — two minutes after the truck pulls out and one minute
when the truck pulls in. Changing this assumption to one minute per
opening makes a big difference: the internal load drops from 297 lbs
per hour to 44 lbs.

the largest component of the total load in
an active warehouse. Reducing it will save

The volume of dry air necessary to remove the load drops from 20,000
cfm to 3,000 cfm, which means a very large reduction in system cost.
This cost reduction is not free — it comes with the knowledge that
supervisors will have to watch door openings closely if the system is to
work properly. The manager still believes this is worth the effort, since
the icing problem is solved at more reasonable cost.
Two other elements of the final moisture load for the dock area are
worth discussing: the transmission load and fresh air load. The trans-
mission load is very small — only 4,000 grains per hour, or less than
one pound. This is not an error in calculation. Many designers become
very concerned about the exact vapor transmission rates of various
materials.

ery small — only 4,000 grains per hour, or less than
one pound. This is not an error in calculation. Many designers become
very concerned about the exact vapor transmission rates of various
materials. Although the question is relevant, it is not normally of great
consequence. For instance, in this case, the permeance factor of 8"
concrete block with vapor barrier paint is 0.38 grains per hour per
square foot per inch of mercury vapor pressure differential across the
wall. If the wall had not been painted, the permeance would have been
2.4 — six times the permeance of painted block. However, the total
permeance load only changes from 4,000 to 16,000 grains per hour,
which is less than 5% of the total load. Door opening assumptions and
air leakage guesses are far more important than knowing whether a
particular paint passes 0.36 or 0.27 grains per hour per square foot.
The assumption concerning fresh air load is immensely more important
because that air carries a great deal of moisture. In this case, local
codes do not require continuous ventilation. If ventilation had been
required, the system would have needed far more capacity because
outdoor air is nearly always more humid than a 33°F dew point.
FIGURE 7.12
This shows the effect of closing the doors
within one minute of each truck’ s departure
rather than leaving the door open for three
minutes — the moisture load is reduced to
25% of its original value.

CHAPTER SEVEN
From the perspective of precision humidity control, these assumptions
are still not very conservative design. If a moderate wind is blowing
against the dock doors, moist air will be forced into the building. (A 15
mph wind travels at 1320 fpm. 5280 ft/mi. x 15 mph = 79,200 fph ÷
60 min/hr = 1320 fpm) But the designer and manager reason that
there is no critical process to be affected by moisture here — the pur-
pose of the project is simply to reduce the problem, not to guarantee it
can never occur under any circumstances. The benefit of this decision
is a less expensive system — the cost of the decision is that the system
will not eliminate the problem on humid, very windy days if doors are
frequently open. Another manager and another designer might choose
to use pre-dried ventilation air to pressurize the building for a more
conservative design — or a more critical requirement.

Step Four —  Size the components to remove the loads
The designer faces a decision — should the moisture load be removed
by a single dehumidifier or by multiple units? A single large unit costs
less to install but two smaller units can save energy when one shuts off
at low load conditions. Given his tight construction budget, the man-
ager decides on a single unit — accepting the possibility of higher oper-
ating cost in return for a lower initial cost.
So the loading dock will be served by a single system at one end of the
dock, mounted on the roof of the building. The system will take air
from above the dock doors, dry it and distribute the dry air down near
the freezer doors. This arrangement sets up a circular air pattern that
sweeps humid air away from the freezer and towards the return duct of
the dehumidifier. How much air is needed to remove the load?
Looking at the performance curves in the appendix, it seems reason-
able to assume that air could be dried from 28 gr/lb down to about 4.8
gr/lb. The total amount of 4.8 grain air needed to remove 44 lbs
(308,000 gr) from a space held at 28 gr/lb would be:
EQUATION 7.

From the performance charts in the Appendix, air entering a desiccant
dehumidifier at 40°F and 28 gr/lb will leave at a moisture condition
between 3.5 and 6.5 gr/lb depending on the reactivation temperature
and the process air velocity through the desiccant bed. Selecting a unit
for 25°F reactivation with a process face area of 7.5 sq.ft., 2950 cfm
will travel through the desiccant wheel at 393 fpm. (2950 ÷  7.5 =
393) The actual leaving condition at 393 FPM is 4.6 gr/lb — low
enough to remove the load from the dock area, as can be seen in the
following calculation:

The example is arranged to come out neatly, which does not always
happen in practice. If the dehumidifier with 7.5 sq.ft. of face area could
only dry the air to 8 grains, the designer would have several possible
courses of action:
• Use a larger dehumidifier
Not an especially attractive alternative in this case, because a larger
unit would cost considerably more to purchase, install and operate.
• Live with the performance of the 7.5 sq.ft. unit selected
The dehumidifier is always sized at the peak load condition, which will
only occur 0.4% of the time — less than 35 of the 8760 hours in a year.

CHAPTER SEVEN
The designer may decide to check moisture load and dehumidifier per-
formance at a more typical summer condition of 80°F, 85 gr/lb, and if
that is adequate, simply accept less than perfect performance at the
extreme condition. But the manager — or a subsequent manager —
may not be pleased with the designer’s efforts or the supplier’s equip-
ment when the system fails to perform at peak conditions.
• Reduce the internal load
A full minute is still a long time to leave a door open — perhaps the
doors can be closed before the trucks pull away from the dock.
Step Five —  Select the control system
There are two issues to address in the control system — modulating the
system components for maximum operating economy and eliminating
the conveyor icing and wet floors.
The dehumidifier control can be an on-off device because there is no
need for precision control within a narrow range of humidity values.
Essentially, the drier the loading dock the better, since moisture not
removed by dehumidifiers at the dock will have to be removed by the
cooling coils and dehumidifiers in the ice cream and candy storage
rooms.

 the drier the loading dock the better, since moisture not
removed by dehumidifiers at the dock will have to be removed by the
cooling coils and dehumidifiers in the ice cream and candy storage
rooms. So there is arguably a case for no control at all — the dock de-
humidifiers could run constantly and benefit the overall system.
Of course the dehumidifiers consume energy, and for several months
the outside air dewpoint is below what is required to prevent frosting
and condensation. Running the units during those dry hours would be
wasteful. There are three choices for the dehumidifier control — rela-
tive humidity, dewpoint or surface condensation controllers. A relative
humidity control set at 80% rh will start the dehumidifier when the air
is above 28 gr/lb as long as the air temperature is 40°F. It is a low-cost
device, and perfectly adequate for the project. Its accuracy is not likely
to be better than ± 2%, and if the air temperature is different than 60°,
it will either under or over-dry the dock by a small amount.
A condensation sensor mounted on the floor or conveyor would be
ideal, since the dehumidifiers would not run if moisture was not con-
densing. But as a practical matter, these devices are too fragile to
mount on floors or conveyors. They are easily dislodged and crushed.
The designer chooses a dewpoint control, and sets it at 33°F.

The designer chooses a dewpoint control, and sets it at 33°F. This is
more accurate than a humidistat, and unlike a condensation sensor it
can be mounted in the air rather than on the busy floor or conveyor.
FIGURE 7.15
The dewpoint control sensor needs to
be located so it will have good air

dock is a good spot unless pallets are
frequently stacked in front of the

control, which saves large amounts of
energy at part-load conditions.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Recognizing that the moisture load will vary widely throughout the
year, the designer also installs a reactivation energy modulating con-
trol. This is a temperature controller, which senses the air temperature
leaving the moist reactivation sector and varies the reactivation heater
capacity to eliminate excess heat for reactivation. Different desiccants
require different reactivation temperatures. In this case, the desiccant
should have a minimum of 120°F leaving reactivation to ensure the
wheel is fully dried.
Other considerations
In all cases, the air from the dehumidifier should be distributed where
it will do the most good. In the dock area, air is distributed along the
rear wall near the doors to the storage rooms.

In all cases, the air from the dehumidifier should be distributed where
it will do the most good. In the dock area, air is distributed along the
rear wall near the doors to the storage rooms. By placing dry air near
those doors, the load on the dehumidifiers in the storage rooms is re-
duced, since the largest moisture load comes from door openings.
In many warehouses, there is no solid door between the dock and stor-
age rooms because there is simply too much traffic across the opening.
This large moisture load can be minimized by using plastic strips to
reduce air infiltration. Strips are particularly important where openings
are tall, and where there is a significant temperature differential across
the opening. Temperature differences cause air density differences. The
relatively heavy cool air falls to the floor, pushing out through the open
doorway and creating a lower pressure higher up in the doorway,
which pulls in warmer, moist air. Overlapping plastic strips covering a
tall doorway can reduce moisture infiltration by blocking this local
suction effect.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Commercial HVAC - Supermarket Example
Commercial and institutional buildings such as supermarkets, hotels,
research laboratories and hospitals often supplement their comfort air
conditioning systems with desiccant dehumidifiers. Dehumidifiers al-
low an engineer to design an HV AC system which handles latent and
sensible loads separately. Independent humidity control is useful when
the sensible heat ratio (SHR) is comparatively low, which is to say the
moisture load is a large proportion of the total heat load on the build-
ing. Dedicated dehumidifiers are also advantageous when the building
moisture load peaks at a different time than the sensible heat load.
Both of these criteria apply when the humidity control level is low, or
when the building uses large amounts of ventilation air. We will con-
sider the example of a new 50,000 square foot supermarket.

sider the example of a new 50,000 square foot supermarket.
Step One —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to improve the operating economics of the
case refrigeration and comfort-conditioning systems by reducing the
relative humidity in the store. Supermarkets are unique because their
HV AC systems have a great deal of excess sensible capacity because of
cool air spilling from refrigerated display cases, which creates a low
sensible heat ratio — often below 70%. In addition, there is an eco-
nomic benefit to maintaining a low dewpoint.
Step Two —  Establishing control levels and tolerances
Since the purpose of the dehumidification system is to remove as much
moisture as possible from the cooling systems, the moisture control
level should be “as low as possible”. Desiccant dehumidifiers can keep
the humidity as low as necessary. Industrial spaces are often kept be-
low 1%rh. In the case of a supermarket, maintaining 35 to 40%rh pro-
vides the optimum balance between equipment cost and operating cost
reduction. (See references)
The engineer sets the temperature control level at 75°F for optimum
comfort.

The engineer sets the temperature control level at 75°F for optimum
comfort. Normal air conditioning applications would be set at 70 to
72°, but supermarket display cases spill so much excess cooling into
the aisles that an average store temperature of 72° would be quite un-
comfortable. The tolerances are fairly broad — ± 3% relative humidity
and ± 3°F for temperature. There is no economic or comfort benefit to
tighter control.
FIGURE 7.18
Commercial and institutional building HVAC
systems often profit by the addition of a
desiccant sub-system. It removes moisture
from the air so the cooling system can
operate more efficiently. In a supermarket,
lowering the humidity reduces the load on
the refrigerated display cases, which saves
power costs.

Step Two —  Calculate heat and moisture loads
The principal heat loads come from heat transfer through the building
wall, lights, windows, people, and from ovens in the bakery area and
fryers at the deli counter. In fact, the heat loads and make-up air re-
quirements in the deli area are so large — and so intermittent — that
the engineer decides to install a separate system to serve that area
alone.

i counter. In fact, the heat loads and make-up air re-
quirements in the deli area are so large — and so intermittent — that
the engineer decides to install a separate system to serve that area
alone. This relieves the central system of a high intermittent load, and
makes both systems more efficient. The remaining sensible load in the
rest of the store totals 750,000 Btu/h, but the spill-over cooling effect of
the display cases will remove 430,000 Btu/h of sensible heat. So the
remaining heat load is 320,000 Btu/h, which must be removed by the
central air handling system.
Like the sensible load, the moisture load is partially offset by the dehu-
midifying effect of the refrigerated cases. Even though the desiccant
dehumidifier will keep the store at 40% relative humidity, the case
cooling systems will still condense water, since the evaporator tempera-
tures run well below a 40°F dewpoint. Refrigerated cases are included
in the load calculations because they actually remove moisture rather
than add it to the store. That total is subtracted from the internal mois-
ture load as shown in the graph.

The largest element of the moisture load is water vapor in the fresh air,
which depends upon the amount of ventilation air the system provides
per person, and upon the number of people likely to be in the space.
The local building code calls for a fresh air ventilation rate of 7 cfm per
person. For 500 people in the store, the engineer designs for a total of
3,500 cfm outside air. Note, however, that ASHRAE Standard 62-1989
— Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality — calls for a ventila-
tion rate of 15 cfm per person in supermarkets. A different designer
might choose to follow ASHRAE guidelines for a higher standard than
required by older local codes. The lower ventilation rate is less costly,
but the air quality will not be as high.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Air leakage through building joints is very difficult to determine be-
cause the structure is very large, and it is impossible to predict in ad-
vance how many cracks of what dimension will be left unfilled in the
construction process. Working with the architect, the engineer finds
that this particular contractor has an excellent reputation, and the ar-
chitect has specified foam-sealed joints between different building ma-
terials, and around duct penetrations and door frames.

that this particular contractor has an excellent reputation, and the ar-
chitect has specified foam-sealed joints between different building ma-
terials, and around duct penetrations and door frames. So the engineer
feels comfortable assuming tight construction, and uses the measured
leakage rate of 0.1 cfm per square foot in a 25 mph wind described in
Chapter 23 of the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. After the
building is built, it would be possible to validate this leakage assump-
tion through the use of blower-door equipment or the use of tracer-gas
tests. These are described in Chapter 5 — Moisture load calculations.
Moisture from door openings presents two important questions — how
much and how often? The engineer plans to supply a slight excess of
air to minimize infiltration, so in theory, air should move out of the
building rather than in whenever the doors are open. In fact, however,
doors create local turbulence as they open, and small pressure differ-
ences between the bottom and top of each door pull moist air in
through the top while dry, cool air pushes out through the bottom. The
engineer decides to assume that 30% of the air volume trapped in the
vestibule between the doors will enter the store each time the doors are
opened.
How often the doors open is also difficult to estimate since the cus-
tomer load varies so widely.

olume trapped in the

How often the doors open is also difficult to estimate since the cus-
tomer load varies so widely. If the engineer uses peak loading — al-
most 900 customers per hour — the system will be inefficient most of
the year, overdrying and overcooling the space at unnecessary cost. A
more appropriate calculation uses the average customer loading per
hour throughout the week, which in this case is 150 customers, or 300
door openings per hour.
This is a compromise. During peak customer load conditions, the hu-
midity may well be above 40% or even above 45% for short periods.
Since people will not be uncomfortable, the engineer reasons that a few
hours per year above the control condition will only slightly increase
the annual operating cost of the refrigeration systems.
Wet surfaces also contribute moisture to the load. The produce depart-
ment displays vegetables in open cases, where an automatic sprinkler
system periodically sprays the merchandise with a fine water mist. The
manufacturer of the spray system tells the engineer that water con-
sumption is 10 lbs per hour for the 120 ft of produce display case
which the store will be installing.

CHAPTER SEVEN
There is a certain amount of water vapor brought into the space in the
form of moist cardboard packaging materials for merchandise. But
most of the package moisture is absorbed into the outer corrugated
cartons which leave the store before they can desorb moisture. By
cross-checking the number of cartons per day with the store manager,
the engineer determines the load from this source is small enough to be
neglected.
Moisture from people is the second largest load after fresh air. Fortu-
nately, this calculation is quite simple once the number of people is
known. Table 3 of Chapter 26 of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamen-
tals estimates the moisture load per person in retail stores at 200 Btu/h.
Converting that load to grains per hour, the engineer multiplies by 6.6
for a total of 1320 gr/hr/person. (The latent heat of water is 1060 Btu’s
per lb, and there are 7000 grains of vapor per lb of water, so 1 Btu =
7000/1060, or 6.6 grains.)
The load from vapor transmission through walls, floor and ceiling is,
like many other dehumidification applications, very small compared to
loads from other sources. In this case, it is 10,000 grains per hour —
less than the moisture added by any eight of the store’s customers.
With the loads defined, the engineer can proceed to the design of the
system.

 sources. In this case, it is 10,000 grains per hour —
less than the moisture added by any eight of the store’s customers.
With the loads defined, the engineer can proceed to the design of the
system.
Step Four —  Size the equipment to remove the loads
After removing the oven and fryer loads with a separate system, the
remaining sensible heat load in the rest of the store is 320,000 Btu/h
and the internal moisture load is 77 lbs per hour (81,620 Btu/h).
In other applications where low-level humidity control is not impor-
tant, designers can quickly estimate cooling equipment size by dividing
the combined latent and sensible loads by 12,000 Btu’s per ton of
cooling capacity and then estimate system airflow by multiplying the
capacity by 400 cfm per ton. This procedure does not work for humid-
ity-controlled supermarkets. It leads to systems with very large airflows
and equipment that over-cools and under-dehumidifies the store.
To take advantage of the best characteristics of desiccants and cooling
equipment, the engineer must think about temperature and moisture as
independent variables. The desiccant sub-system will handle moisture
and the air cooling system will control temperature. The sensible load
and air circulation requirements will determine system airflow, and
moisture need not enter into that calculation. The result will be
smaller, more efficient systems than cooling alone can accomplish.

moisture need not enter into that calculation. The result will be
smaller, more efficient systems than cooling alone can accomplish.
133
SYSTEM DESIGN
If sensible heat removal was the only concern, the system airflow could
be set purely according to the allowable temperature rise across the
store. For example, if the minimum allowable discharge temperature
was 55°F (to avoid chilling people where the cool air is discharged),
the supply air volume could be 14,815 cfm (cfm = 320,000÷ (20*1.08).
However, in practice, engineers designing supermarkets do not use
such small airflows because there might be too much thermal stratifica-
tion in the wintertime. Typical desiccant-based designs use a minimum
air volume of 1/2 cfm per square foot of store area, even though both
sensible and moisture loads could be satisfied with less air. In this case,
the engineer prefers to use the larger airflow, increasing the minimum
supply air volume from 14,815 to 25,000 cfm.
Once the supply air volume and fresh air volume are established, the
engineer can calculate the temperature and moisture conditions that
will enter the central air handler. The dehumidifier is selected first be-
cause it will convert the latent heat in the air to sensible heat, which
will affect the cooling system.
Summer design conditions for the ventilation air are 95°F, 120 gr/lb.

Summer design conditions for the ventilation air are 95°F, 120 gr/lb.
Calculating the return air temperature from the store is a bit more in-
volved because the air is taken from the aisles rather than from high in
the store wall. This is done to remove excessively cold air from the
aisles near refrigerated display cases, so it can be recirculated to areas
where cooling is needed. This means the return temperature will not be
the average temperature of the store — 75° — but somewhat lower.
How much lower depends on how much air is returned from the cases
and how much from the higher walls.
Empirical data from test stores has established that even when 100% of
the return air is taken from the aisles, a maximum of 50% of the case
cooling “credit” affects the temperature of the return air. The balance of
the cooling effect stays in the store. To calculate this reduction in return
air temperature, the engineer solves this equation:

CHAPTER SEVEN
Since the return air conditions are now known, the engineer can calcu-
late the blended temperature and moisture conditions of the air mix-
ture, and move on to sizing the dehumidifier.
At low humidity levels, desiccant dehumidifiers dry air much more
effectively than cooling systems. Therefore, it is not necessary to dry all
the supply air to maintain conditions at 40% relative humidity. A small
portion of air is dried very deeply, and mixed with the rest of the sup-
ply air to provide the level of dryness that will remove the load.
The first step is to determine how dry the entire supply air stream must
be made. The following equation solves for the necessary difference in
moisture between the air as it enters and as it later leaves the store.

Moisture = 65 gr/lb
T emperature = 69.8° F
The next question is how dry the air can be made by the drier. The
performance curves in the Appendix show that if air enters at 70°F and
65 gr/lb, it can leave between 13 and 19 gr/lb depending on the tem-

perature of the reactivation air and on the speed of the air through the
desiccant wheel. High process air velocity and high reactivation air
temperature means the dehumidifier will be smaller — therefore less
expensive to purchase.
To minimize installed cost, the engineer starts with the assumption that
the dehumidifier will operate at 600 fpm process air velocity and 250°F
reactivation air temperature, drying the process air to 19 gr/lb. Then
the amount of 19 grain air that will bring 25,000 cfm at 65 gr/lb to the
necessary 51 gr/lb is:

Step Five —  Select the control system
The temperature and moisture in the store must be controlled, and the
dehumidifier and cooler must modulate in response to load changes
due to weather and store operation. The main system fan will operate
continuously, so air is constantly circulated throughout the space.
The humidity control can be a simple, low-cost, on-off humidistat.
There is no need for precision control, and the control level is a com-
paratively high 40%rh. Some care should be taken, however, in locat-
ing the sensor. It should be at least ten feet off the floor to prevent
accidental tampering. It should be located in the center of the store in a
dry-goods aisle, because the lower aisle temperature created by refriger-
ated cases will disturb the reading.

accidental tampering. It should be located in the center of the store in a
dry-goods aisle, because the lower aisle temperature created by refriger-
ated cases will disturb the reading. If the sensor is much higher than 10
feet off the floor, the air temperature will be above the control point,
which will again affect the relative humidity reading. Using a dewpoint
sensor avoids the problem of temperature interference with the humid-
ity reading, although the cost of such a sensor-controller is somewhat
higher than a simple humidistat.
The cooling system can also be controlled with an on-off thermostat.
The engineer reasons that it should be located with the humidistat in
the center of the store away from the frozen food so it will sense an
average air temperature.
Both the cooler and dehumidifier need to modulate their energy con-
sumption in response to load changes. Cooling can be modulated by
equipping the system with compressor cylinder unloading valves.

SYSTEM DESIGN
These open in response to a change in pressure in the suction line from
the evaporator coil, reducing the load on the compressor motor and
therefore reducing energy consumption.
The dehumidifier reactivation energy is controlled by a temperature
controller located in the air stream leaving the reactivation sector. As
the moisture load on the unit decreases, less moisture passes out
through the reactivation sector, making the air temperature rise. The
controller then reduces the energy to the reactivation heater so that a
constant 120°F is maintained in the air stream leaving reactivation.
An important control often overlooked by the HV AC system designer is
the defrost system for the refrigerated cases. One of the major benefits
of the lower humidity in the store is the reduction in frequency of de-
frost in the display case cooling coils. However, many defrost systems
are controlled by a time-clock. In this system, the designer sets a timer
according to an estimate of the defrost need rather than actually mea-
suring the frost. Such timers do not allow the store owners to realize
the full benefits of lower store humidity since the clock setting will
always under or over estimate the need for defrost. A better alternative
control uses a light-emitting diode (LED) and photo receptor to mea-
sure the frost thickness on the refrigerant evaporator tubes, initiating
defrost only when frosting actually reaches an unacceptable level.

Other considerations
Supply air, which is cool and dry, should be distributed at the front of
the store. Both the moisture and sensible heat loads are concentrated at
the front of the store — where the people, windows and door openings
are located. Comfort will be improved, and door opening loads will be
minimized if supply air is first distributed at the front of the store over
the registers.
The principal cost of operating a desiccant dehumidifier is the cost of
energy for desiccant reactivation. In the case of a supermarket or other
commercial applications, a key reason for installing a dehumidifier is to
reduce operating cost, so the source and cost of reactivation energy is
worth considering carefully. Supermarkets all have large amounts of
waste heat from display case refrigeration systems which can be used
to pre-heat the air before the main reactivation heater. Also, many util-
ity companies provide exceptionally attractive rates for natural gas
consumed in the summertime. The engineer can often cut the opera-
tional cost of the dehumidifier in half through imaginative use of these
low-cost energy sources.
Even temperature and humidity control
depend on a close fit of the system to the
loads.

Even temperature and humidity control
depend on a close fit of the system to the
loads. Whenever the heat and moisture
loads in an isolated area are much larger
or smaller than the loads in the rest of the
store, it makes sense to install a separate
system to handle that area. The example
describes a separate system for the deli
and bakery.
In an actual installation, a designer made
the mistake of pulling a small amount of
air from the central system to cool and
heat the store manager’ s office. The
manager was alternately roasted and
frozen as the system responded to the
needs of the store rather than to the
conditions in the office.

SYSTEM DESIGN
Industrial HVAC - Pharmaceutical Tableting
Industrial desiccant systems allow faster production of better quality
material than would be possible at high moisture levels. Controlling
humidity at low levels may mean the difference between profitable and
unprofitable manufacturing. Therefore, engineers often think about
industrial desiccant systems the same way they think about production
equipment. Like any machine tool that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, the dehumidification system must be built to be exceptionally
reliable and economical to operate. We’ll look at a typical application
in the pharmaceutical industry.
FIGURE 7.23
Pharmaceutical mixing, tableting and
packaging operations are often carried out in
low-humidity environments. In this example,
we examine the decisions an engineer makes
as he designs a system to control a room at a
moisture level of 10% relative humidity.

low-humidity environments. In this example,
we examine the decisions an engineer makes
as he designs a system to control a room at a
moisture level of 10% relative humidity.
Step One —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to prevent effervescent powders and tab-
lets from absorbing moisture from the air. Dry powders allow the
tableting presses to operate at very high speeds, and dry tablets have a
long shelf-life. The room measures 30' x 40' x 8'. The process has three
steps: dry powders are mixed in large blenders, then the powder is
compressed into tablets which are packaged and stacked onto pallets
for shipment.
Step Two —  Establish control levels and tolerances
Temperature uniformity is not critical to this process. There are no tight
tolerances affected by thermal expansion or contraction. Worker com-
fort is the main concern, so the project engineer sets the control level
Integrated dehumidifcation system

at 70°F with a tolerance of ± 3°. In fact, he knows many workers pre-
fer a higher temperature in this type of low-humidity environment, but
he designs for 70°F to ensure the system will have adequate capacity
for all circumstances.
Humidity control is more critical. We will assume product development
engineers have found that moisture absorption by the powders during
manufacturing is the limiting factor on shelf-life.

umstances.
Humidity control is more critical. We will assume product development
engineers have found that moisture absorption by the powders during
manufacturing is the limiting factor on shelf-life. At this company, they
have said “the drier the better, but we can live with 10% rh as a maxi-
mum because that eliminates 95% of the moisture absorption”. So hu-
midity is set at 10% rh. However, since the temperature will be allowed
to swing three degrees above and below the set point, 10% relative
humidity could represent between 9.7 and 11.8 gr/lb in terms of hu-
midity ratio. When the humidity level is this low, such a difference can
have major cost implications. To avoid confusion, the engineer speci-
fies the dew point absolutely — a 13°F dewpoint (11 gr/lb).
Step Three —  Calculate the heat and moisture loads
The room is built inside a larger building, so its walls, ceiling and floor
are not exposed to the weather. Since the rest of the building is air-
conditioned, there is almost no temperature difference across the room
walls. The main sensible heat gains are from the motors which drive
the mixers, tableting presses and packaging machinery. The lights and
people also add heat. The total load is 41,000 Btu/h.

The moisture load calculations show that moisture inside the room is a
small proportion of the total load. The load chart shows the impact of
fresh air on the room. Its huge relative size demands a closer examination.
FIGURE 7.24
The exhaust hood over the mixers removes
500 cfm from the room. The air that replaces
this exhaust carries a great deal of moisture,
and is the largest load on the system.
The loads inside the room consist largely of
worker’s respired moisture and moisture
which enters whenever a door is opened.
Vapor transmission through walls, ceiling and
floor is almost negligible.
141
SYSTEM DESIGN
The engineer finds that the load consists of 800 cfm. He puts the room
under positive pressure using 300 cfm (to minimize leaks) then adds
500 cfm to make up for air exhausted from exhaust hood over the mix-
ers. Unfortunately there is no way to reduce those flows. The exhaust is
essential and the hood is already at the minimum size necessary to
capture particles and solvents emitted from mixers. Although the fresh
air flow cannot be reduced, the engineer makes a note to reduce the
load by pre-cooling the air before it goes to the dehumidifier. Outside
air enters the system at 91°F and with a moisture level of 147 gr/lb.
These are ideal conditions for cooling-based dehumidification.

 by pre-cooling the air before it goes to the dehumidifier. Outside
air enters the system at 91°F and with a moisture level of 147 gr/lb.
These are ideal conditions for cooling-based dehumidification.
Pre-cooling the air to 50° will remove 60% of its moisture load, and the
lower temperature of the air will improve performance of the desiccant
unit as well. Very little can be done to reduce the load from people, but
the engineer cuts the load from door openings in half by adding air-
locked vestibules on the two personnel doors. The product door can be
air-locked, but that would require quite a bit of space in the aisle out-
side the room. Since the door only opens once every hour, the reduc-
tion in moisture load would not be worth the cost and inconvenience
of a large airlock.
The room is built from standard 3/4" sheetrock painted with industrial
latex-based vapor-retarder wall paint. The joints are taped and the
seams between walls and floor are caulked, so the load from vapor
transmission is only 471 gr/hr — hardly enough to show on the chart.
The engineer calculates a small amount of leakage around the product
door. Although he has specified a gasketed door frame, the engineer
does not expect the gasketing to stay intact as pallets run over the
frame each day.
The final total sensible heat load is 41,000 Btu/h and the internal mois-
ture load is 105,000 gr/hr — 15 lbs of water vapor per hour.

ture load is 105,000 gr/hr — 15 lbs of water vapor per hour.
Step Four —  Select and size components
Sizing the components begins with the decision of how much air to
supply to the room. This airflow must satisfy three criteria. It must be
large enough to meet air circulation requirements, and large enough to
remove both heat and moisture loads. The engineer must find the mini-
mum airflow that will satisfy all three requirements.
The load in this example was calculated
using the guidance in Chapter 5.
However, equally qualified engineers may
differ on calculation assumptions for the
same set of circumstances.
For example, one senior engineer
working in the pharmaceutical industry
has found it very difficult to anticipate
how the room will actually be used.
Based on long experience, this engineer
has found the uncertainty of most pre-
construction moisture load calculations
has been:
Fresh air volume ............. ±15%
Duct leaks ................... ±100%
Other air leaks ............... ±50%
Dehumidifier leaks ............ ±50%
# of Door openings ........... ±50%
Wet surface area ............. ±25%
Product moisture ............. ±50%
# of occupants ............... ±25%
Vapor transmission ........... ±50%

CHAPTER SEVEN
In this case, the supply air quantity is established by company policy.
Design practice at this particular company requires a minimum of 20
air turns per hour in production rooms. They find this enhances unifor-
mity of the temperature and moisture throughout the space, improving
comfort and production consistency. The room measures 30' x 40' x 8',
a total of 9,600 ft
3. Circulating the air 20 times an hour will require
9,600 x 20, or 3,200 cubic feet per minute.
The minimum airflow necessary to remove the heat load depends on
the allowable temperature differential between supply and return air.
To make sure people are not chilled by the supply air, the engineer
does not want to deliver air lower than 60°F. This equation shows the
airflow necessary to remove the sensible load based on a 10 degree
differential between supply and return.

cfm = 3796
This means the system supply air must be at least 3800 cfm rather than
the 3200 cfm which would satisfy the air circulation requirement.
The air needed to remove the moisture load likewise depends on the
differential between the supply and return airstreams.

 rather than
the 3200 cfm which would satisfy the air circulation requirement.
The air needed to remove the moisture load likewise depends on the
differential between the supply and return airstreams. But where the
engineer can safely assume a cooling system can cool air by 10°F, he
cannot automatically assume the dehumidifier can dry the air by a
convenient amount. At high moisture levels, it may be easy to remove
30 gr/lb. At entering conditions of 15 gr/lb, it is difficult to remove
more than 14 gr/lb.
So before he can determine the volume of air necessary to remove the
moisture load, the engineer must determine how dry the supply air can
be made. At this point, he knows three things:
• Supply air volume must be at least 3800 cfm to properly cool the room
• Return moisture condition is 11 gr/lb (70°F, 10% rh)
• Outside airflow is 800 cfm. It will be pre-cooled to 50°F, 54 gr/lb.
143
SYSTEM DESIGN
With these facts, the engineer can estimate the performance of the
desiccant dehumidifier to see how dry the supply air can be made. This
will tell him if the airflow that removes the sensible heat will be large
enough to remove the moisture load. Assuming a total airflow of 3800
cfm, he calculates the blended air conditions entering the dehumidifier:

Moisture =
T emperature= 66° F
20 gr/lb
Consulting the dehumidifier performance curves for a rotary lithium
chloride dehumidifier, the engineer sees that air entering the dehumidi-
fier at 72°F and 20 gr/lb can exit between 1.5 and 5 gr/lb, depending
on the velocity of the air through the desiccant bed. A unit with 7.5
sq.ft. of free face area will process 3,800 cfm at a velocity of 506 ft/
min. Air entering at 20 gr/lb leaves the unit at a moisture condition of
4.0 gr/lb. The engineer checks the capacity of this selection against the
moisture load:
EQUATION 7.10 Proposed supply airflow (cfm)
Density of air ( lbs/cuft/min )
Minutes per hour (min)
Moisture difference between supply
and return airstreams (gr/lb)
capacity = 3,800 × .075 × 60 × (11 − 4)
capacity = 119,700 gr/hr
Since the load inside the room is 105,000 gr/hr, the airflow of 3,800
cfm delivered at a moisture condition of 4.0 gr/lb will be sufficient to
remove the load, with 15% extra capacity in reserve.

Note that if the air from the weather had not been cooled and dehu-

condition of 74°F and 37 gr/lb. In that case, the air could only have
been dried to 7 gr/lb. This would have required a dehumidifier twice
the size of the unit selected, and much more than 3,800 cfm of supply
air to remove the 105,000 gr/hr load.

the air could only have
been dried to 7 gr/lb. This would have required a dehumidifier twice
the size of the unit selected, and much more than 3,800 cfm of supply
air to remove the 105,000 gr/hr load. If pre-conditioned air is not avail-
able from a central system, it pays to dehumidify the weather air with a
cooling system before it enters the desiccant dehumidifier.
The load in the room is treated separately from the load in the fresh air.
The engineer concentrates on making the air dry enough to remove the
internal load. He knows that the load in the ventilation air will be re-
moved by the dehumidifier before it gets into the room. If the untreated
weather air was somehow fed directly into the room, the dehumidifier
would have to be much larger. For example, if the 500 cfm for the hood
was not supplied by the system but simply allowed to leak into the
room from the weather, it would add 306,000 gr/hr — almost quadru-
pling the room load. Therefore the system would require a dehumidi-
fier almost four times the size of the 7.5 sq.ft. unit.
At this point, the engineer has established the supply airflow and the
size of the dehumidifier. Now he can size the cooling downstream of
the dehumidifier, knowing that the air must be delivered to the room at
60°F.

costly than using either one alone.

Since cold air will be entering the system in winter, the engineer checks
the winter temperature design extreme to size a heating coil. Air will
enter from the weather at -5°F in the winter, which makes the tempera-
ture of the blended air 54°.
During the summer, the supply air temperature to the room is 60°F, but
in the winter, that may not be high enough. Supplying air at 60° as-
sumes there will be a full sensible heat load in the space — all the
equipment is running, all the people are in the room and all the lights
are on. In the winter , the system must be able to keep the room at 70°
even if there is only a partial sensible load in the space. So the engineer
sizes the heater to bring the supply air temperature from 54° to 70°.

R SEVEN
The mixing operation is hooded and vented, but past experience with
similar installations suggests there is still a need for filtration to remove
particulate from the main air handling system. The engineer places
roughing filters (35% removal efficiency) where air enters the system:
one on the weather air and another at the return. These will provide as
much protection as the system components require. Then he places a
bank of high efficiency filters (95% removal efficiency) downstream of
all system components. This will protect the process from particles
which bypass the roughing filters and any particles generated inside
the system itself.
Air regulation is another important aspect of system design. Airflows
through the system will change with changes in weather temperature
and pressure unless airflow can be fixed. The engineer places fixed-
position, flow-setting dampers at the return from the room and the
fresh air intake.
It is particularly important to control the exhaust airflow from the
hood. If too much air is pulled from the room, untreated air will leak
into the room, making it difficult to maintain moisture control. The
designer specifies an exhaust hood with automatic airflow control to
minimize the potential problem.
Step Five —  Select the controls
The control system must modulate the capacity of each component so
the system can respond to load changes. It must also ensure each com-
ponent uses only the minimum energy necessary to meet those loads.

SYSTEM DESIGN
In addition, since the room must be maintained under a positive air
pressure, the airflow from the weather must be increased or decreased
automatically as the room pressure changes throughout the day.
Room air pressure is maintained by a differential pressure controller
which automatically adjusts a damper in the fresh air intake. As air
pressure in the room rises above a set differential, the damper closes to
reduce the incoming air.

pressure in the room rises above a set differential, the damper closes to
reduce the incoming air. When the pressure falls — like when the prod-
uct door is opened to let the pallet-jack through — the damper opens
to allow more fresh air to pressurize the room.
The dehumidifier capacity is controlled by passing air around the unit
when less dehumidification is necessary. The dehumidifier dries less
air, and the blended condition of the supply air rises, so the system
does not over-dry the room at part-load conditions. This works well as
long as the resistance to airflow is the same through the bypass as
through the dehumidifier, so the engineer places a fixed-position, flow-
setting damper in the bypass. Equalizing the bypass and desiccant
wheel resistance allows for smooth modulation of capacity.
The system controls room humidity by closing and opening the bypass
dampers when a dewpoint controller signals a humidity change. That
control does not, however, automatically reduce energy consumption as
the load changes.
To minimize energy use, the engineer installs a temperature controller
in the airstream leaving reactivation. The controller senses air tempera-
ture, reducing the energy of reactivation heaters whenever the tempera-
ture rises above set point.

that all the moisture absorbed on the process air side has been des-
orbed in reactivation. If the temperature falls, there is more moisture
being absorbed in process, so more energy is required in reactivation. If
the temperature rises, there is less moisture on the process side and the
reactivation energy can be reduced.
The cooling coils are supplied with chilled water from a central system.
The flow of chilled water through the fresh air coil is controlled by a
three-way valve which responds to a controller located well down-
stream of the coil. The controller modulates the chilled water flow rate
to maintain a constant 50°F air temperature leaving the coil. The post-
cooling coil is controlled the same way, but the temperature sensor is
located in the room, since its function is to maintain a constant room
temperature.

When steam or hot water is used for
reactivation, the heater temperature can
remain constant, and the reactivation
airflow is reduced by means of inlet vanes
on the fan, or motor speed control. This
method has the advantage of reducing fan
energy as well as heater energy. It would
not be appropriate for electric or gas
reactivation since reduced airflow could
lead to heater failure.

The supply air heating coil is electric. It responds to the same sensor
that controls the post-cooling coil, and its proportioning controller in-
creases the power to the heating element whenever the room tempera-
ture drops below 68°F.
Other considerations
Weather design conditions
Early in a project, the engineer must decide what weather air tempera-
ture and moisture conditions to use as design points. In this case, the
engineer chose the 1% summer design for both temperature and mois-
ture. This means that over the course of the four summer months, the
weather conditions will only exceed these values for 1% of the time —
26 hours. In this case, the decision was easy. Production is continuous,
and if the system does not perform to specifications, the product loss is
very costly.

exceed these values for 1% of the time —
26 hours. In this case, the decision was easy. Production is continuous,
and if the system does not perform to specifications, the product loss is
very costly. In less critical applications, the engineer may prefer to use
less extreme conditions; perhaps the 2.5% conditions from this hand-
book, or even the much less extreme ASHRAE design data. But he
should do so with the clear understanding that for many hours of the
year, such a system cannot maintain 10%rh in the room.
Cooling system controls
In the example, we conveniently assumed the cooling would be accom-
plished with chilled water coils. If direct expansion refrigeration had to
be used instead, the engineer would have had to decide whether to
feed both coils from the same condensing unit, or install separate units
for each coil. Installed cost will favor a single system, and control sim-
plicity will favor separate systems.
The load on the post-cooling coil will be constant any time the outside
air temperature is above 50°F — more than half the year. But the load
on the pre-cooling coil will change as the weather changes. The engi-
neer must provide for this load change in both the refrigerant piping
and compressor control systems.
Energy recovery
Even with energy modulation, the cost to run this system will be high
because it operates continuously.

Energy recovery
Even with energy modulation, the cost to run this system will be high
because it operates continuously. The engineer could further reduce
this cost by recovering waste heat from either of two sources — refrig-
eration compressors and reactivation air exhaust. This waste heat can
be used to warm the reactivation air before it enters the heaters.
FIGURE 7.29
Operational cost can be reduced by
recovering heat from the reactivation
exhaust, and using it to pre-heat the air
going to the heaters.
It is important to remember that the hot,
wet reactivation air will condense gallons of
water inside the heat exchanger, so the
condensate must be properly drained.

149
SYSTEM DESIGN
Waste heat from reactivation is substantial in this case. The unit uses
1,300 cfm of reactivation air, which leaves the unit at 120°F all year
long. When the outside air temperature is 55°, an air-to-air heat ex-
changer could easily recover 60% of that temperature difference, or
91,200 Btu/h. It is important to remember, however, that a heat ex-
changer in the hot moist reactivation will condense a great deal of
moisture — in this case several gallons per hour. The heat exchanger
and ductwork must be arranged so the condensate runs to a drain and
not back to the dehumidifier.
Another energy-saving option is to use waste heat from the refrigera-
tion system to pre-heat air entering reactivation.

Another energy-saving option is to use waste heat from the refrigera-

reactivation increases the normal surface area available for refrigerant
condensation.

Product Drying - Candy Coating Example
Dehumidification systems which dry products often provide their own-
ers with exceptionally large profits. In many cases, using dehumidified
air to dry products can double the processing speed of a production
line, and increase product quality as well. Perhaps even more than
industrial building room control systems, a product drying dehumidifi-
cation system is like a machine tool — it can pay back its installation
cost in months or even weeks rather than decades. For our example, we
will look at a “bin drying” system for covering candy pieces with a
hard, shiny coating.

Step One —  Define the purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to reduce humidity of the drying air, so
the fast production rates of winter can be maintained through summer,
spring and fall. Historically, the process goes out of control during the
summer. Moist weather makes the air too wet to dry the coating at high
speed. The coating gets blotchy, uneven and candy pieces stick to-
gether. We can imagine an existing system which has previously used
air from other parts of the building to dry the coating. That air was
cool, but very moist.
Integrated dehumidifcation system
Step Two —  Establish control levels and tolerances
Depending on the time of the year and on product demand, the com-
pany runs one of two products through these particular drying bins.
• Chocolate-covered nuts with a thin sugar shell coating
• Hard-coated sugar candy — similar to “Jawbreakers”
Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to dry
products when there is a benefit from
either a very low dewpoint, or a very low
drying temperature, or both.
For example, the emulsions in
photographic film are “ set” by cold air
and chilled rolls at temperatures between
0°F and 20°.

For example, the emulsions in
photographic film are “ set” by cold air
and chilled rolls at temperatures between
0°F and 20°. Dry, cold air is necessary to
set the emulsion, to remove some of its
water and to insure no condensation
occurs on the cold film surface.
In contrast, PET plastic resin is very
hygroscopic. 300 °F air with a dewpoint of
-40 (0.5 gr/lb) is used to remove the last
vestiges of moisture from the resin before
processing. Film manufacturing is
continuous, and plastic resin drying is
typically done in batches. Both processes
are possible without dry air, but the
speed is at least doubled by using
dehumidifiers.
FIGURE 7.30
Confectionery, pharmaceutical and chemical
manufacturing frequently use dry air in
coating and drying operations. This
example describes how fresh air is taken
from the weather and conditioned to meet
two different drying requirements.
151
SYSTEM DESIGN
The products are not run at the same time, and air temperature and
moisture requirements for each product are different. The chocolate
product needs cold air, because otherwise the chocolate loses its “tem-
per” (recrystallizes above its melting point) from the heat generated by
the tumbling action of the product in the bin. On the other hand, the
hard candy needs hot air to set the sugar coating and to form an espe-
cially smooth and shiny surface which is part of the product’s primary
marketing identity.

uct in the bin. On the other hand, the
hard candy needs hot air to set the sugar coating and to form an espe-
cially smooth and shiny surface which is part of the product’s primary
marketing identity.
Past processing has shown that 65°F is adequate for the chocolate
product, but winter production has shown that 50° is even better be-
cause that keeps the pieces quite hard, reducing dents in them caused
by tumbling in the bin. The hard candy product will need 120° air to
set the shiny coating.
The drier the air, the faster the product coating will dry. Unfortunately,
two factors limit how dry the air can be as it is fed to the drying bins
— system cost and over drying. The drier the air, the more it will cost
to buy and run the system. Also, if the air is too dry, the sugar coatings
crystallize in an amorphous pattern, which results in weak layers
which crack easily. Without resources to have laboratory tests con-
ducted, the engineer is confused about how to establish the humidity
level that will give the fastest speed without over drying. This delays
the project past the deadline for capital budget approvals, so the project
is put on hold for a year.
During the following summer and winter seasons, the engineer decides
to rent a desiccant dehumidifier to make some experiments on the dry-
ing system itself.

is put on hold for a year.
During the following summer and winter seasons, the engineer decides
to rent a desiccant dehumidifier to make some experiments on the dry-
ing system itself. The results of these experiments confirm that the
following conditions are optimum for each product:
• 50°F, 50%rh (27 gr/lb) for the chocolate product
• 120°F, 9%rh (44 gr/lb) for the hard candy
• 250 cfm airflow for each drying bin
Step Three —  Calculate heat and moisture loads
The existing system must be entirely changed. It simply takes cool air
from the room, blowing it into each of 12 rotating drying bins. There
are exhaust fans in the ceiling that pull moist air out of the building,
but there is no make-up air system to supply treated air to the room.
This means air has to be pulled into the room from other production
areas by the exhaust fans. The engineer needs an entirely new system
concept before he can calculate loads.
152
CHAPTER SEVEN
First, the engineer must decide where the drying air will come from,
and whether it will continue to be exhausted to the weather or re-
turned to the dehumidification system. If it returns to the system, will it
do so directly, or will it be pulled through the entire room after it leaves
the drying bins? If the air is returned from the drying bins directly, it
will carry only the moisture load from the coating. If it comes back
through the room, it will contain the moisture loads from the room as
well as the product.

turned from the drying bins directly, it
will carry only the moisture load from the coating. If it comes back
through the room, it will contain the moisture loads from the room as
well as the product.
The engineer makes two fundamental decisions: take air from the
weather rather than the building and exhaust it directly from the drying
bins to the weather, returning no air to the dehumidification system.
He reasons that the old practice of pulling air from the building simply
places the cooling load on systems in the rest of the building which are
already overloaded. By putting the drying bins on an independent sys-
tem that treats its own outside air, he can improve conditions in the
rest of the building as well as improve the coating operation.
By not returning air to the dehumidification system after it leaves the
bins, the engineer greatly simplifies his maintenance work. If the air
returned to the system it would have to be heavily filtered to remove
sticky, unsanitary sugar dust. Filter systems are available, but the engi-
neer knows his maintenance technicians do not have time for current,
critical tasks. He knows he will get no increase in maintenance budgets
to hire people to carefully maintain an expensive filtration system.

s his maintenance technicians do not have time for current,
critical tasks. He knows he will get no increase in maintenance budgets
to hire people to carefully maintain an expensive filtration system.
In making this decision, the engineer has also looked at the moisture
conditions in the weather compared to the moisture of the air leaving
the coating pans, recognizing that if the air from the pans is drier, the
dehumidifier will use more energy than if the system takes air from the
weather. He found that for half of the year, the air from the weather is
actually drier than the air leaving the bins, so weather air is less expen-
sive to process. An optimized system would switch the intake auto-
matically between the bins and the weather, whichever is drier — but
the engineer rejects that alternative in the interest of simplicity and
reduced maintenance.

These decisions have certainly simplified the moisture load calculation.
The only heat and moisture loads on the system are contained in air
taken from the weather. There are no relevant room loads, people or
door openings. The system must simply take fresh air and deliver it at
120°F and 44 gr/lb for the hard candy, and 50°, 27 gr/lb for the choco-
late-covered nuts.

120°F and 44 gr/lb for the hard candy, and 50°, 27 gr/lb for the choco-
late-covered nuts.
The sensible heat load consists of three elements:
• Sensible heat generated by product pieces tumbling in the drying bin
• Sensible heat from the fresh air
• Latent heat in the fresh air, converted to sensible heat by the
dehumidifier
Experience has shown that heat generated by the product can be re-
moved by supplying air at 50°F for the chocolate. Sensible heat from
the outside air is the difference between the summer design tempera-
ture and the 50° delivered air condition to the bins — 133,000 Btu/h.
Latent heat in the fresh air will be converted to sensible heat by the
dehumidifier, in proportion to the amount of moisture the unit re-
moves. The more moisture removed, the warmer the air will be follow-
ing the dehumidifier. When the engineer sizes the dehumidifier, he will
know the sensible load from the dehumidification process.
FIGURE 7.31
Since air is not returned to the system after it
picks up moisture from the bins, the only
moisture loads are the water vapor contained
in the fresh air and the moisture from the wet
product itself.

delivered to the bins (° F)
heating load = 3000 × 1.08 × (120 − 11 )
heating load = 353,160 Btu/h
In theory, there might also be a need to humidify the fresh air in win-
ter, since the moisture outside will be lower than the 27 gr/lb and 44
gr/lb that seem to be ideal for the products. But in fact, the engineer
has never noticed a problem with excessive dryness in winter, so he
does not bother to calculate a humidification load.
Step Four —  Size the components to remove the load
Since desiccant dehumidification converts moisture to sensible heat,
the dehumidifier must be selected and its performance determined
before sizing the cooling system which follows the dehumidifier. The
size of the dehumidifier depends on the temperature and moisture con-
ditions of the entering air. Economically, it makes sense to pre-cool and
dehumidify the fresh air before it enters the desiccant unit. The ques-
tion is — how much pre-cooling is appropriate?
The answer depends on whether the thermal energy used for reactiva-
tion is less expensive than the electric power that runs the cooling sys-
tem.

 ques-
tion is — how much pre-cooling is appropriate?
The answer depends on whether the thermal energy used for reactiva-
tion is less expensive than the electric power that runs the cooling sys-
tem. When reactivation energy is inexpensive, the dehumidifier can
remove moisture at low cost. The unit will cost more to install, but
operating cost savings can offset that additional cost in a matter of
months. Conversely, if reactivation energy is comparatively expensive,
then cooling dehumidification should take as much of the load as prac-
tical — the installation will be less costly to install and run.
In this case, the engineer plans to use waste heat from a cogeneration
plant for reactivation, so the cost of running the desiccant unit will be
almost negligible. Therefore the only appropriate pre-cooling is the
minimum necessary to let the desiccant unit deliver the 27 gr/lb condi-
tion required by the chocolate product.

SYSTEM DESIGN
The engineer consults the performance charts in the Appendix for ro-
tating Honeycombe® dehumidifiers. Based on his known requirement
for 3,000 cfm, he selects a model with 7.5 sq.ft. process face area, then
he runs the performance curves in the reverse of the normal sequence.
3,000 cfm will move through this unit at 400 feet per minute. (3,000 ÷

 selects a model with 7.5 sq.ft. process face area, then
he runs the performance curves in the reverse of the normal sequence.
3,000 cfm will move through this unit at 400 feet per minute. (3,000 ÷
7.5 = 400 fpm) Starting with the desired end condition of 27 gr/lb, he
moves left to the 400 feet per minute velocity curve, then vertically to
the 190°F reactivation temperature line and right to the 65° entering
temperature line and down to the inlet moisture condition, which reads
95 gr/lb. This means that if the air enters the desiccant unit no warmer
than 65° and no wetter than 95 grains, the 7.5 sq.ft. unit can deliver
the required 27 gr/lb condition.
The engineer uses the 190°F reactivation temperature because the co-
generation system provides 200°F water, so the hottest practical tem-
perature for reactivation is 190°. Finally the engineer assumes a
process air inlet temperature of 65°F because that allows the wettest
possible inlet condition. In fact, if air is pre-cooled to 65°, it will be
saturated and have a moisture content of 93 gr/lb.
This tells the engineer what the pre-cooling coil must accomplish — it
must bring the air from a summer design condition of 91° and 146 gr/
lb to a condition of 65° and 92 gr/lb.

Step Five —  Select the controls
Temperature and humidity must be controlled to meet the needs of
both products. Equipment energy consumption must modulate to fol-
low the loads, so energy is not wasted.
Humidity control is achieved through a set of modulating dampers
which bypass air around the dehumidifier when the moisture load is
low. Humidity must be controlled at two fixed points: 44 gr/lb and 27
gr/lb. While these two conditions are quite close together in absolute
humidity, they are very far apart in relative humidity. Since the 27
grain condition is delivered at 50°F, it represents 50% relative humid-
ity. The 44 grain condition is delivered at 120°, therefore it represents
9% relative humidity. Relative humidity sensors control well at a single
point, where the sensor can be calibrated and used constantly, but they
would need recalibration when the control point shifts. Also, relative
humidity sensors in general are less accurate than other types when
measuring below 10% relative humidity.

The engineer decides to use an optical dewpoint sensor-controller and
to control the system based on dewpoint rather than relative humidity.
Because the air temperature is quite high, the optical sensor is ordered
with extra cooling capacity to ensure accuracy. Also, the sensor is
placed well downstream of the desiccant unit, since the outlet moisture
conditions vary widely across the wheel face. A better location for the

sensor is immediately before the air enters the short distribution ducts
to the bins — at that point the air is reasonably uniform in temperature
and moisture across the duct.
Airstream temperature is controlled in two places — before and after
the dehumidifier. Air is pre-cooled for partial dehumidification. That
coil is the direct-expansion type, served by its own condensing unit.
This frees capacity in the central chilled water system. The pre-cooling
system is controlled by a temperature sensor/controller immediately
following the cooling coil. It is set at 65°F. Anytime the air temperature
is above 65, the system will cool and dehumidify the incoming air.

following the cooling coil. It is set at 65°F. Anytime the air temperature
is above 65, the system will cool and dehumidify the incoming air.
The post-cooling coil is served by the central chilled water system. The
engineer placed the cooling coil downstream of the heating coil to
make sure the water in the coil will not freeze during winter operation.
In theory, the maintenance department can prevent coils from freezing
by draining their water in wintertime. But the engineer knows that the
weather changes faster than the hard-pressed maintenance technicians
can drain and refill the coil. The post-heating coil is provided with wa-
ter at 200°F from the cogeneration plant, just like the reactivation heat-
ing coils for the dehumidifier.
FIGURE 7.33
The dehumidifier is installed with a bypass
so its capacity can reduce when fresh air
is drier than the design condition. The
fixed-position damper in the bypass
creates a resistance equal to that of the
desiccant bed. This lets the bypass
dampers modulate airflow smoothly
through both dehumidifier and bypass.
The fixed-position damper at the inlet to
the system allows the engineer to set the
system airflow exactly, so there is less
variation in flowrate with changes in
weather air temperature and pressure.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Both post-heating and post-cooling coils are controlled by three-way
valves which modulate fluid flow in response to a temperature sensor
included with the optical dewpoint controller. Another advantage to
this more costly instrument is that temperature and humidity set points
can be reset at the process control console rather than having to send
technicians into the ductwork.
Because there is such wide variation in moisture loads from the
weather, the dehumidifier energy requirements will also vary widely.
The unit should reduce energy automatically in response to these
changes. This is less important during the summer months, because
there is an excess of heat from the cogeneration system. But during the
winter, all available thermal energy is needed to provide comfort and
process heating.
The dehumidifier reactivation energy is controlled by changing the hot
water flow through the heating coils in response to a temperature sen-
sor/controller located in the airstream leaving reactivation. The control-
ler is set at 120°F. As the air temperature rises above that point, it
means there is less moisture being absorbed on the process side, and
reactivation energy can be reduced.

Other considerations
Freeze-protection
This project uses hot water from a cogeneration system for reactivation
and supply air heating. In the winter there is a danger of freezing the
water in the coils, which would burst the tubes. To avoid this potential
problem, the engineer could take air from a warm mechanical room
rather than directly from the weather. Alternately, an electric or natural
gas pre-heater could be placed on the outside air intake to the system.
In any case, hot water-based heating systems for weather air are sub-
ject to freezing in cold climates, and the engineer must take precau-
tions to avoid the problem.
Supply air fan location
In the example, the supply air fan is located downstream of the desic-
cant dehumidifier. This provides for good mixing between the dehu-
midified and bypassed air, but it places the ductwork between the fan
and the dehumidifier under a strong negative pressure compared to the
air outside the duct — which is moist. The negative air pressure can
lead to air leaks through duct joints, and leakage within the dehumidi-
fier casing, so both should be well sealed if the fan is in this location.

SYSTEM DESIGN
lem downstream of the unit, but the designer must take care to avoid
blowing the air directly at the face of the desiccant wheel. Otherwise
air will not move through the bypass duct when necessary.
Pre-cooling
One of the reasons it makes sense to use minimum pre-cooling in prod-
uct drying applications is the need for a warm or a hot temperature
combined with dry air. Since the dehumidifier is converting the mois-
ture load to sensible heat, the process benefits. However, if this project
dealt only with the heat-sensitive chocolate product, the operating and
installation costs could be reduced by doing as much pre-cooling as the
refrigeration system will allow. Refrigeration capacity is almost always
less costly to buy than desiccant dehumidification capacity until the
cooling system encounters a freezing problem. The practical lower limit
for chilling outside air is debatable. Most engineers would agree that
45°F for direct expansion cooling and 40°F in glycol-water systems are
achievable, although the cooling coils will be very deep and the resis-
tance to airflow will be quite high.

Optimum conditions can change in mid-cycle
In this example the airflow, temperature and moisture can stay con-
stant because product batches are identical in size, shape, type of
coating and degree of dryness required. However, in other temperature-
sensitive, batch-oriented drying applications such as investment cast-
ings, fish filets or seeds, it may be important to be able to change
temperature, air velocity and humidity throughout the drying cycle to
avoid over-drying. When this is necessary, the engineer may wish to
invest in more complex controls to automatically re-set the air volume,
temperature and moisture in mid-cycle for best results.
Total system airflow
In many product drying applications, the total system airflow is large,
because of the need to maintain high velocity across all surfaces of the
product. But the dehumidifier need not handle all that air. For example,
consider that instead of small candies in a small drying bin, the engi-
neer is trying to dry large investment casting “Christmas trees” in a
room measuring 50' wide x 75' long x 18' high. The moisture load may
only be 50 lbs of water vapor per hour. The dehumidifier will be small
in comparison to the airflow required to create high velocity on all the
complex product surfaces.

drying a small portion of the total air in circulation.

n this chapter, we will examine dehumidification systems for larger
rooms and buildings in more detail, since there are many alternate
means of achieving the same dehumidification result.
The central issue is to determine the optimum mixture of cooling and
desiccant dehumidification that will result in the lowest possible first
cost and operating cost for a given set of circumstances. We will con-
sider five possible system schematics for a single circumstance, and
show the operating cost and first cost consequences of each of the al-
ternatives.
The equations and calculations in this chapter assume the reader is
familiar with basic heating and air conditioning terms and numerical
relationships. If this is not the case, we suggest that the reader examine
Chapters 2 and 7 before proceeding with this material.

Example Case Description
Humidity control systems for buildings often involve heating and cool-
ing as well as humidification and dehumidification. Since cooling will
generally be accomplished with refrigeration, the engineer can often
use that equipment to dehumidify as well. The questions then become:
how much cooling equipment and how much desiccant equipment is
appropriate in a mixed system, and how should the components be
arranged for maximum economy? We will consider the following spe-
cific case:
FIGURE 8.1
In this example, the moisture control level is below the practical limita-
tions of a system based only on cooling dehumidification — a desiccant
unit will be necessary to meet the specification. There are many pos-
sible system configurations, and we will examine the four shown on
the facing page.
System 1 – Dry the make-up air only
This alternative can be quickly assessed without detailed calculations
or selecting specific components. Assume the make-up air could be
dried very deeply — down to a moisture content of 1 grain per pound.
Then it could remove the following amount of moisture from the room:
Moisture removal =400 x 4.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Since the internal moisture load is 181,000 gr/hr, it is obvious that dry
make-up air alone cannot meet the design requirements. In other cases
— such as a clean room where the make-up air may be a larger volume
and the internal moisture load smaller, drying the outside air is often
the best alternative. This is also true in many commercial buildings,
where the moisture control level might be higher, which gives each
cubic foot of dry make-up air more moisture removal capacity. In any
event, drying the make-up air alone will not suffice in this case.

System 2 – Pre-cool the make-up air and dry the blend with a
desiccant unit
Using the available chilled water, we pre-cool the make-up air to 55°F,
64 gr/lb and blend it with return air. The desiccant unit must then re-
move the internal load as well as the remaining moisture from the
make up air. This total load is the sum of the internal load plus the
moisture remaining in the make-up air after the cooling coil:
Total load = 181,800 + [(4.5 x 400 x (64-30)] = 243,000 gr/hr
To determine dehumidifier performance, we must know the tempera-
ture and moisture content of the air entering the unit, and to determine
those values, we need to know how much return air is being blended
with the make-up air. This combined air quantity generally depends on
the space cooling requirement and on the minimum allowable tempera-
ture that can be supplied to the space. To avoid uncomfortable drafts,
we will set the minimum supply air temperature at 55°F, which allows
us to calculate the total air quantity needed to remove the internal sen-
sible heat load:
Total supply airflow = 100,000 ÷ [1.

we will set the minimum supply air temperature at 55°F, which allows
us to calculate the total air quantity needed to remove the internal sen-
sible heat load:
Total supply airflow = 100,000 ÷ [1.08 x (70-55)] = 6173 scfm
So the blended air condition to the dehumidifier will be at the follow-
ing condition:
Make-up air 400 scfm @ 55 °F, 64 gr/lb
Return air 5773 scfm @ 70°F, 30 gr/lb
Total 6173 scfm @ 69 °F, 32 gr/lb
Selecting the appropriate size dehumidifier is essentially an iterative
process — the designer must determine the smallest unit that will re-
move the 181,800 gr/hr load from the air stream. Using the rotary
Honeycombe® dehumidifier performance data given in the appendix,
the designer selects a unit with a nominal face area of 3.75 sq.ft. to dry
2250 scfm of air to a moisture content of 6.2 gr/lb. The unit performs
as follows:
167
OPTIMIZING MIXED SYSTEMS
Inlet conditions: 2250 scfm @ 69 °F, 32 gr/lb
Face velocity = 2250 ÷ 3.75 = 600 fpm
Outlet moisture content = 6.2 gr/lb
Moisture removal = 4.5 x 2250 x (32 - 6.2) = 261,225 gr/hr
Process air temperature rise = .625 x (32 - 6.2) + [.07 x (250 - 69)] = 28.8 °F
Process air outlet temperature = 69 + 28.8 = 97.8 °F
Reactivation air volume = 2250 x [(97.8 - 69) ÷ (250 -120)] = 500 scfm
Reactivation energy at design = 500 x [(250 - 95) x 1.08] = 83,700 Btu/h
The total sensible heat load consists of the internal load plus the heat
from the dehumidification process:
Total sensible load = 100,000 + [1.08 x 2250 x (97.

500 x [(250 - 95) x 1.08] = 83,700 Btu/h
The total sensible heat load consists of the internal load plus the heat
from the dehumidification process:
Total sensible load = 100,000 + [1.08 x 2250 x (97.9 - 70)] = 167,797 Btu/h
The total cooling includes this sensible heat, plus the pre-cooling for
the make-up air:
Total cooling = 167,797 + [4.5 x 400 x (44.9 - 23.1)] = 207,037 Btu/h
We can see this design calls for the following investments:
Cooling Capacity = 17.2 tons
Dehumidifier size = 3.75 sq.ft process air face area
Required desiccant reactivation heat = 83,700 Btu/h
System 3 – Pre-cool the blended air before it enters the desiccant unit
Without pre-cooling the make-up air, we allow it to blend with the
return air, and then cool the mixture before it enters the desiccant de-
humidifier. The moisture load on the dehumidifier is larger, since the
outdoor air moisture has not been removed from the make-up air:
Moisture load = [181,000] + [4.5 x 400 x (140 - 30)] = 379,800 gr/hr
The conditions of the air entering the cooling coil in front of the dehu-
midifier are calculated as before:
Make-up air 400 scfm @ 95 °F, 140 gr/lb
Return air 5773 scfm @ 70°F, 30 gr/lb
Total 6173 scfm @ 71.6 °F, 37 gr/lb
The designer iterates as before, finding that a larger dehumidifier must
be used. A unit with 7.5 instead of 3.75 sq.ft. is selected, and it per-
forms as follows:
Inlet conditions: 2500 scfm @ 55 °F, 37 gr/lb
Face velocity = 2500 ÷ 7.5 = 333 fpm
Outlet moisture content = 1.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Moisture removal = 4.5 x 2500 x (37 - 1.5) = 399,375 gr/hr
Process air temperature rise = .625 x (37 - 1.5) + [.06 x (250 - 55)] = 33.9 °F
Process air outlet temperature = 55+ 33.9 = 88.9 °F
Reactivation air volume = 2500 x [(88.9 - 55) ÷ (250 -120)] = 652 scfm
Reactivation energy at design = 652 x [(250 - 95) x 1.08] = 109,145 Btu/h
The total sensible heat load now consists of the internal load plus the
heat from the dehumidification process plus the pre-cooling of the
blended air entering the dehumidifier:
Total sensible load = 100,000 + [1.08 x 2500 x (88.9 - 70)] +
[1.08 x 6173 x (71.6 - 55)] = 261,670 Btu/h
Summarizing this system, we can see the following investments:
Cooling Capacity = 21.8 tons
Dehumidifier size = 7.5 sq.ft process air face area
Required desiccant reactivation heat = 109,145 Btu/h
System 3 uses a desiccant unit twice the size of the unit in system two,
and a cooling system that is 25% larger than the cooling in system two.
This is the result of not removing any moisture with the cooling sys-
tem. However, system three has a much greater “reserve” moisture
removal capacity, because the desiccant unit — currently handling
2500 cfm — could dry up to 4500 cfm if necessary.

removal capacity, because the desiccant unit — currently handling
2500 cfm — could dry up to 4500 cfm if necessary.
System 4 - Eliminate all pre-cooling and remove all moisture with
desiccants
Since the desiccant unit selected in system three has substantial extra
capacity, the engineer can examine the possibility of using the same
unit without pre-cooling of any kind, and use low-cost, low-tempera-
ture heat for desiccant reactivation. In this case, we will assume that
waste heat from a cogeneration system is available to heat the reactiva-
tion air to 200°F.
The moisture load is the same as the previous cases:
Moisture load = [181,800] + [4.5 x 400 x (140 - 30)] = 379,800 gr/hr
The conditions of the air entering the dehumidifier are calculated as
before:
Make-up air 400 scfm @ 95 °F, 140 gr/lb
Return air 5773 scfm @ 70°F, 30 gr/lb
Total 6173 scfm @ 71.6 °F, 37 gr/lb
169
OPTIMIZING MIXED SYSTEMS
The goal is to use the smallest possible amount of process air that will
result in removing 379,800 gr/hr from the total airflow of 6173 scfm @
71.6°F, 37 gr/lb. If reactivation air enters at 200°F, the process air will
leave the unit between 8 and 11.5 gr/lb, depending on process air ve-
locity. {“The slower, the lower” as a maintenance technician once ob-

leave the unit between 8 and 11.5 gr/lb, depending on process air ve-
locity. {“The slower, the lower” as a maintenance technician once ob-
served}. The designer can make an estimate of the necessary process
airflow by assuming the worst case (wettest outlet):
Estimated process airflow = 379,800 ÷ [4.5 x (37 - 11.5)] = 3310 scfm
3310 cfm actually moves through a unit with 7.5 sq.ft. process face area
at a rate of 441 fpm ( 3516 ÷ 7.5 = 441 ), so performance will be better
than the 11.5 grain “worst case”, which occurs at 600 fpm. Consulting
the unit performance chart for a velocity of 441 fpm, the designer con-
cludes the air will leave the unit at 10 gr/lb.
Moisture removal = 4.5 x 3310 x (37 - 10) = 402,165 gr/hr
The capacity is ample. Complete performance data can now be
calculated:
Inlet conditions: 3310 scfm @ 71.6 °F, 37 gr/lb
Face velocity = 3310 ÷ 7.5 = 441 fpm
Outlet moisture content = 10 gr/lb
Process air temperature rise = .625 x (37 - 10) + [.08 x (200 - 71.6)] = 27.1 °
Process air outlet temperature = 71.6 + 27.1 = 98.7 °F
Reactivation air volume = 3310 x [(98.7 - 71.6) ÷ (200 -120)] = 1121 scfm
Reactivation energy at design = 1121 x [(200 - 95) x 1.08] = 127,121 Btu/h
The total sensible heat load consists of the internal load plus the heat
from the dehumidification process:
Total heat load = 100,000 + [1.08 x 3310 x (98.

Dehumidifier size = 7.5 sq.ft face area
Required desiccant reactivation heat = 127,121 Btu/h
Interestingly, this alternative results in less total cooling than either
system three or system two, and still has quite a bit of reserve capacity.
The designer could decide to install two reactivation heaters in series
— the first using low-temperature waste heat, to heat the air to 200°.
The second heater could boost the air temperature to 250°, which
would improve moisture removal for future increases in moisture load,

or allow the room to operate at a lower humidity control level for dif-
ferent products. It would also be necessary, however, to add cooling
capacity in that situation. Sensible heat load is partly a function of the
amount of water removed by the desiccant unit.
Comparing Alternatives
The table and graphic on the facing page compare the four alternate
systems. Each has advantages and disadvantages. For example:
• System 1 has enough capacity to remove the load from the make-up
air, but cannot remove the internal load from the room.

e four alternate
systems. Each has advantages and disadvantages. For example:
• System 1 has enough capacity to remove the load from the make-up
air, but cannot remove the internal load from the room. If the volume
of make-up air were larger, the internal load smaller or the control
dewpoint higher, this system would be the smallest and most economi-
cal to operate. However, in this case, such an arrangement cannot
work.
• System 2 is the least costly to purchase. It has the smallest desiccant
unit, a small cooling plant and the least amount of reactivation energy.
However, it just barely removes the load from the room. The designer
may want to re-check the moisture load calculations if this system is
chosen, or perhaps use the next size desiccant unit.
 • System 3 provides more moisture removal capacity than system 2 by
increasing the desiccant dehumidifier size and by improving desiccant
performance with cool inlet air at the same time. This system will be
the most costly to install and operate. However, if the original load
calculations were perhaps more of a guess than a firm calculation, or if
there is a need for future expansion, this system may be a wise choice.
• System 4 is more costly to install than system 1, but less costly than
system 2, and it will certainly be the least expensive to operate. Using
waste heat to reactivate the desiccant keeps energy costs to a mini-
mum.

to remove the sensible heat load — not to pre-cool to improve desic-
cant performance. On an annual basis, this system will probably cost
less than half the operating cost of system 3, but will still have the
same reserve capacity if the designer installs a high-temperature reacti-
vation heater and extra cooling for future use.

The diagram on the facing page shows a logical thought-path to the
dehumidification system that will cost the least to install and operate.
But as the preceding exercise demonstrates, there can be many circum-
stances that alter the general case. As we described in Chapter 7, it is
essential that the dehumidification system designer understand the
basic purpose of the project. This understanding provides a map
through the maze of trade-offs between the capacity, energy and first
cost of dehumidification systems.

nstrumentation to measure and control moisture and humidity is
very diverse. For a complete discussion, humidity instrumentation
would need a separate and equally large handbook. However, there
are some fundamental issues and basic operating principles which are
useful to know when designing dehumidification systems. This chapter

qually large handbook. However, there
are some fundamental issues and basic operating principles which are
useful to know when designing dehumidification systems. This chapter
deals with those basics.
Since there are so many options for instrumentation, it is important to
avoid becoming confused by details, and to maintain a perspective on
what is truly important in a given application. If a designer is laying
out an archival storage room for paper documents, there is no need to
be concerned about ± 1% repeatability, dewpoint measurements accu-
rate to ± 0.5°F or response times under 4 seconds — these issues are
irrelevant. But conversely, if an engineer is designing a photographic
film manufacturing line producing $5,000 worth of product every thirty
seconds, he or she should not be overly concerned about the cost of
the control — small errors or machine downtime will cost more in a
few minutes than the cost of the most expensive instruments available.
In this chapter, we will discuss a framework for making decisions about
instrumentation, and basic operating principles of different devices.
176
CHAPTER NINE
Moisture and humidity instruments are differentiated according to the
type of measurement they take, the duty cycle on which they take it and
the functions they perform once the measurement is taken. The system
designer can quickly choose from the bewildering array of instruments
once these variables have been defined for the application in question.

designer can quickly choose from the bewildering array of instruments
once these variables have been defined for the application in question.
Types of Measurements
Instruments can measure the relative humidity of air, its specific humid-
ity and the moisture content of solids. Instruments for each of these
functions are different.
• Relative humidity sensors generally measure the change in a mate-
rial that results from absorption of moisture from the surrounding air.
Many materials are moisture sensitive and suitable for the purpose. As
early as 1550, Leonardo Da Vinci observed that a ball of wool weighs
more on a rainy day than on a dry day. Human and animal hair also
gets longer as it absorbs moisture, which is what causes hair to curl on
a muggy day. And the electrical characteristics of plastics change as
they absorb moisture. Instruments can measure these changes and
make a numerical correlation to changes in relative humidity in the
surrounding air.
• Absolute humidity sensors either use a chemical reaction to “count”
water molecules, or cause condensation on a cold surface with a
known temperature. The first recorded use of a condensation hygrom-
eter was in 1751, when the French naturalist Charles LeRoy added ice
to cool a water-filled, polished-steel container while taking the tem-
perature of the water.

ecorded use of a condensation hygrom-
eter was in 1751, when the French naturalist Charles LeRoy added ice
to cool a water-filled, polished-steel container while taking the tem-
perature of the water. When drops of condensation formed on the out-
side of the container, he was able to define the dewpoint of the
surrounding air. The same phenomenon is still in use today, and with
electronic controls, such “condensation hygrometers” are very precise.
• Moisture content of solids can be determined by measuring some
property of the material that differs with moisture content, or by re-
moving all the water from a sample of the material and measuring the
weight change. For instance, water absorbs infrared energy very effi-
ciently. When a solid material is exposed to infrared radiation, sensors
can measure the difference between the reflected radiation and what is
absorbed by the material. The difference is proportional to the moisture
content of the material surface.
177
HUMIDITY & MOISTURE INSTRUMENTATION
Accurate primary measurements — those which measure the specific
amount of moisture independent of another variable like air or material
temperature — are more accurate, but more costly. Often, less expen-
sive measurement systems can, through electronics, produce a specific
moisture reading by sensing two or more variables and calculating the
primary moisture value.

 but more costly. Often, less expen-
sive measurement systems can, through electronics, produce a specific
moisture reading by sensing two or more variables and calculating the
primary moisture value. For instance, sensors which measure tempera-
ture, pressure and relative humidity can use these values to calculate
dewpoint or humidity ratio.
Generally, however, it is good practice to measure the variable of inter-
est directly rather than converting from other values when project eco-
nomics allow. For example, consider an application to reduce moisture
absorption by hygroscopic powders in a pharmaceutical tableting op-
eration. In most cases, moisture absorption depends on the relative
humidity in the air surrounding the material, not on the air dew point
or humidity ratio. In this case, it would be wise to look for instruments
which respond to changes in relative humidity rather than air
dewpoint.
Conversely, an application to control condensation on cold pipes in a
water treatment plant cannot be controlled efficiently by measuring
relative humidity on a wall ten feet from the pipes. Condensation can
occur at any relative humidity in the air — it depends on the difference
between the air dewpoint and the pipe surface temperature. In that
case, the designer needs an instrument which senses either air dew
point, or the difference between the dew point and the surface tem-
perature.

Duty Cycle & Operating Environment
Another fundamental difference between instruments is the duty cycle
they were designed to satisfy. Some are suitable for batch samples,
while others provide a continuous measurement.
For instance, the “gravimetric train” is generally agreed to be the most
accurate known moisture measurement device. It is used by national
standards agencies throughout the world as the primary standard by
which other devices are calibrated. However, the instrument is huge,
slow and very costly, requiring several trained technicians for opera-
tion, and capable of measuring only one or two small air samples each
day. While it is accurate, the gravimetric train is clearly not suited for
controlling a continuous industrial process.

CHAPTER NINE
Likewise, instruments designed for continuous duty are not generally
as accurate as instruments which can take a long time to measure
moisture of a small sample. Also, sensors designed for continuously
measuring small changes very accurately may be less accurate and less
repeatable when they must measure very different conditions in a short
period of time.

le. Also, sensors designed for continuously
measuring small changes very accurately may be less accurate and less
repeatable when they must measure very different conditions in a short
period of time. For instance, an aluminum oxide dewpoint sensor is an
accurate device for continuous measurements in a narrow range of low
dewpoints, but if it must measure an environmental simulation cham-
ber cycling rapidly between dry and saturated conditions, its accuracy
and repeatability will suffer.
The operating environment for a sensor may also influence the selec-
tion. For example, if there are a number of condensible gases in the air
other than water, a condensation-type hygrometer may read a dewpoint
of a contaminant rather than water vapor. Likewise, if there are corro-
sive vapors in a hot airstream, an aluminum oxide sensor may well
react chemically with the corrosives, altering its electrical characteris-
tics and hence the water vapor reading.
Strategies to deal with difficult operating environments are as diverse
as the possible circumstances, and instrument manufacturers can pro-
vide guidance in each case. In general, if the environment is extreme in
any sense — near saturated or near zero humidity, or very hot or very
cold, or highly corrosive — the system designer should be prepared to
seek expert advice, and share all the circumstances of use with the
advisor.

it may be more practical to specify a low-cost, replaceable sensor in a
corrosive environment than to take extraordinary precautions to protect
a more costly device.
Accuracy of measurement, short response time, wide measurement
range and tolerance of extreme environments are not mutually exclu-
sive characteristics in a humidity sensor, but when all are necessary,
the device will be expensive.
Instrument Functions
There are four basic functions a moisture instrument can perform,
including:
• Sensing humidity or moisture content
• Indicating the measurement
• Recording the measurement
• Controlling a dehumidification or humidification system
FIGURE 9.1

HUMIDITY & MOISTURE INSTRUMENTATION
As a measurement signal passes through different functions in series,
inaccuracies accumulate, just as a story changes as it is repeated from
person to person. This is because each function has four limits which
affect the final result:
• Repeatability (precision)
• Range
• Response time
• Durability in the specified operating environment
As the number of instrument functions increase and their performance
specifications tighten, the instrument becomes more costly and there is
more potential for error. This is not an argument for single-function
instruments, but since cost is always an issue, the designer should
realize that if the instrument seems expensive or difficult to use, it may
be because it has more functions than required, or because the specifi-
cations for each function may be too restrictive.
For example, a fertilizer storage shelter may have a pressing need for
humidity control, since moist fertilizer can become as hard as concrete.
But there may not be any need to actually know or to record the hu-
midity. It may be enough simply to sense the humidity and control a
switch which turns on the dehumidifier. That device is a simple com-
mercial humidistat, costing less than $100 in 2002 dollars. If there is a
need to indicate the humidity, the instrument will cost more, and a
chart to record the humidity will in turn add further cost.

chart to record the humidity will in turn add further cost.
Purchasing several single-function instruments is an alternative to add-
ing functions to the original instrument. A thermometer to measure dry
bulb temperature and a plastic-element dial hygrometer are often less
costly than an electronic instrument that combines both functions. The
multiple-instrument alternative is especially attractive when the specifi-
cations for one function are much tighter than for another. For in-
stance, in a Lithium battery dry room, the dewpoint is critical, and the
temperature is much less so. The hygrometer must have a tolerance of
± 0.05 grains per pound because moisture affects the product, but the
temperature measurement can accommodate a wider tolerance.
While using separate instruments for different functions is often less
costly, it can also be confusing if two instruments read the same vari-
able. For example, if a chart recorder has its own humidity sensor, it
will never agree precisely with the reading taken by a separate humi-
distat that controls the dehumidifier. In fact, two apparently identical
sensors will each have a slightly different response to the same envi-
ronment.

CHAPTER NINE
Repeatability vs. Accuracy
Every instrument has its own accuracy, tolerances and response times,
which are unlikely to coincide exactly with any other instrument. They
will disagree much like equally intelligent people, who may describe
the same event from different perspectives. Instrument discrepancies
can be minimized by calibrating both instruments at the same time, in
the actual range where both will be used. Where cost is more impor-
tant than exact agreement between instruments, separate instruments
may be an economical alternative.
It is useful to understand the relationship between accuracy and repeat-
ability. Accuracy is the ability of the instrument to indicate the true
value of the humidity. Repeatability is the ability of the instrument to
indicate the original value when returning to the original humidity.

racy is the ability of the instrument to indicate the true
value of the humidity. Repeatability is the ability of the instrument to
indicate the original value when returning to the original humidity. If
an instrument is highly repeatable, it can be made accurate through
calibration. If it is not repeatable, the instrument can never be accurate.
Recognizing this, instrument manufacturers generally define the repeat-
ability of their products in their standard product data sheets.
Low-cost sensors are sometimes described in terms of “accuracy”
alone. System designers evaluating such devices might want to ask the
manufacturer for more detailed information about repeatability within
the expected temperature and moisture range if accuracy is truly impor-
tant in a given application. Repeatability, and therefore accuracy, is
seldom uniform through the whole range of an instrument’s possible
operation. Generally, repeatability is better in the middle of the range
than at the extremes.
Now we will examine the operating principles of the three types of
moisture sensors.
Relative Humidity Sensors
In general, relative humidity sensors are based on the change of me-
chanical or electrical properties of materials that result from changes in
the surrounding humidity. We will look at a representative sample of
such sensors individually.

the fact that human hair changes length in proportion to the relative
humidity of the surrounding air. The higher the humidity, the longer

Repeatability vs. accuracy
The first instrument is not accurate at the
moment, since it does not indicate the
actual humidity value. but it can be made
accurate through calibration, because it is
repeatable — for any given actual value, it
will consistently indicate a number within
2.5% rh of its original indication.
The second sensor happens to be accurate
in this one case, but since its repeatability is
poor, the next observation is unlikely to be
accurate, and calibration will not improve its
accuracy.

the hair. Manufacturers generally use a bundle of hairs. This averages
the individual responses of each strand, since different hairs responds
at slightly different rates of expansion and contraction.
Sources of measurement error include the response of different hairs,
and the response of the mechanical linkage which connects the hair to
the indicating scale. An accuracy of ± 5 to 7% rh is a common result
for hair hygrometers, but like many other instruments, they can be
more accurate in the middle of the relative humidity scale than at the
very high or low ranges. Accuracy may be closer to ± 2 to 3% rh be-
tween 40 and 60% rh at room temperatures. Outside of that range,
accuracy will decline.
To improve accuracy, the device should be calibrated in the room
where it will be used, and calibrated at a condition in the humidity
range expected for the room. Designers should maintain a healthy
skepticism concerning hair hygrometer readings, including those mar-
keted as “certified”. Often a small tap with a finger is enough to change
a humidity reading by three percent, as the mechanical linkage can
seize up over time. They are best used as a general indication of hu-
midity rather than for important readings.
A contemporary adaptation of the hair hygrometer is the plastic expan-
sion hygrometer. In this popular and economical instrument, the hair is
replaced by a hygroscopic polymer like nylon, polyimide plastic or
cellulose.

many inexpensive industrial humidistats use this type of sensor. While
the hygroscopic polymer is more uniform than human hair, the same
advisory cautions apply — do not expect accuracy greater than ± 7%
rh, calibrate them regularly in the environment where they are used
and one should not expect accuracy if wide swings in relative humidity
are common.
Electronic expansion hygrometer
In the mechanical hygrometer, the change in expansion of material is
measured and indicated by a mechanical linkage of gears, levers and
dials. A modification of this concept replaces the linkage with electron-
ics. Hair, plastic and in one case, a desert plant seed case is connected
to an electronic strain guage which measures the pressure exerted as
the sensing element contracts. This is often an improvement over me-
chanical hygrometers, since electronics tend to be more repeatable than
linkages, particularly over long periods of time.

CHAPTER NINE
Electronic capacitance sensor
Briefly described, a capacitor stores an electrical charge. In its simplest
form, it consists of two metal plates separated by an insulator. If other
factors are equal, the charge of the capacitor and the resistance it pre-
sents to a circuit depend on the insulating capacity of the separator
between the plates, a property called its dielectric constant.
Capacitors used in most electronics are sealed because moisture
changes the dielectric constant of the separator. If the capacitor is open
to the air, its resistance changes with humidity as the separator absorbs
and desorbs moisture. This provides the operating principal of the elec-
tronic capacitance sensor. Resistance of an open capacitor is measured
electronically and converted to a corresponding relative humidity.
The variable capacitor used in moisture sensors can be constructed
with many different kinds of separators. Hygroscopic polymers and
aluminum oxide are the most common. The ideal separator is one
which has a very high dielectric constant when dry and very low when
moist. The larger the difference, the easier it is to measure.

aluminum oxide are the most common. The ideal separator is one
which has a very high dielectric constant when dry and very low when
moist. The larger the difference, the easier it is to measure.
Like any sensor, there are some sources of error in capacitance sensors,
principally in linearity of the signal and aging of sensor materials. Di-
electric constants of even the best materials are not strict linear func-
tions of relative humidity. The change in dielectric constant is smaller
at high or low humidity extremes than in the middle of the range, so
the signal must be linearized before it is converted to a relative humid-
ity value. Otherwise, the signal underestimates the humidity changes at
the top and bottom of the scale. Normally this is accomplished within
the sensor circuitry, but linearization is sometimes accomplished at the
destination rather than the source of the signal.
Also, many of the separator materials best suited to capacitance sen-
sors can change characteristics over time, particularly if they become
saturated with condensation or have to measure airstreams with heavy
chemical contamination. This does not imply that they are less suitable
than other types of sensors — simply that like any other instrument,
regular calibration can improve accuracy, particularly when the instru-
ment is calibrated at the midpoint of its expected measurement range.

For example, it would not be wise to rely on an instrument calibrated
at 75°F and 65% rh if it must function accurately at 70°F and 10% rh
— the moisture levels are too different for reliable measurements.
Electronic resistive sensor
The electrical resistance of certain polymers can change according to
the water vapor they absorb, and the rate of absorption is a function of
relative humidity of the surrounding air. In one such system, two elec-

Since the phenomenon takes place in the bulk of the polymer rather
than only on the surface, this type of sensor tends to be more accurate
and more stable than capacitive devices when measuring relative hu-
midities above 90%. Capacitive devices, in contrast, have better sensi-
tivity than resistive sensors at relative humidities below 15% since they
detect surface absorption of small amounts of moisture more readily
than the bulk polymer.
Psychrometric instruments
One of the most common methods of measuring relative humidity uses
a pair of matched thermometers to sense the difference between the
wet and dry bulb temperatures of the air. These instruments use two
thermometers, one dry and the other covered with a wet wick. The wet
thermometer shows a lower temperature than the dry one, because the
evaporating water takes the heat required for its vaporization from the
body of the thermometer itself. This lowers the temperature around the
sensing bulb.
The amount of cooling depends on the rate of evaporation, which de-
pends on the amount of moisture already in the air — the drier the air,
the more cooling takes place, and the lower the wet bulb temperature
will be.

ling depends on the rate of evaporation, which de-
pends on the amount of moisture already in the air — the drier the air,
the more cooling takes place, and the lower the wet bulb temperature
will be. The wet bulb temperature drops until an equilibrium is reached
between the heat loss due to evaporation and the heat supply due to
heat transfer from the surrounding air. When the wet bulb and dry
bulb temperatures of the air are known all other properties including
relative humidity and dewpoint can be determined by reading a psy-
chrometric chart as described in Chapter Two.
This principle is the basis of the common sling psychrometer, an inex-
pensive, lightweight instrument for measuring air moisture. The wet
and dry bulb thermometers are mounted in a sling. After the wick on
the wet bulb thermometer is wetted, the operator spins the sling rap-
idly in a circle. The water evaporates from the wick, and the wet bulb
reading drops until all the water evaporates — then the wet bulb tem-
perature begins to rise towards the dry bulb temperature. Generally, the
operator repeats the process five to seven times to make sure he has
seen the lowest wet bulb reading, which will be the most correct.
FIGURE 9.8
Wet & dry bulb thermometers
The difference between the wet and dry
bulb temperatures of the air provide an

CHAPTER NINE
There are many limitations to the technique since there are so many
uncontrolled variables in using a sling psychrometer. The operator
must read the thermometer accurately at the point of maximum wet
bulb depression. And there is no guarantee that the water on the wick
lasted long enough to read the true wet bulb — it may have evaporated
entirely before the evaporation rate came into equilibrium with the heat
transfer rate. The wick must be absolutely clean — even the natural
skin oils from light handling can change the wet bulb reading by two
or three degrees Fahrenheit. The wick must be completely and uni-
formly wetted. The rate of spin — therefore the air velocity across the
wetted wick must be a minimum of 600 feet per minute. And the water
must be very pure — distilled water is recommended to avoid contami-
nation of the wick. In short, the instrument is useful for approxima-
tions, but only the most experienced and meticulous operators can
obtain consistent results.

Some instruments use wet and dry bulb measurements under more
controlled conditions. The aspirated psychrometer is an example. Wet
and dry bulb thermometers are mounted in a case with a battery-pow-
ered fan and a liquid reservoir to feed water to the wet bulb wick. The
fan draws air first across the dry bulb and then across the wet bulb at a
constant rate. Because the wet bulb wick has a reservoir, the tempera-
ture stays relatively constant, making it much easier to read. Wick
cleanliness is still very important, and thermometer accuracy and read-
ability affect the accuracy of the reading.
ASHRAE (The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Con-
ditioning Engineers) suggests that with careful operation, aspirated
psychrometers can yield accuracy within +5% relative humidity at
dewpoints above 32°F.
The largest errors occur when the difference between wet and dry bulb
temperatures is the greatest — low relative humidities. Also note that
the error is always positive, never negative, which is to say the tech-
nique will always overestimate the amount of moisture in the air rather
than read below the true moisture content.

Some of the relative humidity sensors described previously also display
specific humidity readings, which they derive mathematically by com-
bining dry bulb temperature with relative humidity. The sensors de-

Gravimetric train
This instrument is not used to control or indicate moisture in dehu-

In the gravimetric technique, a technician weighs a small amount of a
powerful drying agent, typically phosphoric anhydride (P
2O5). The dry-
ing agent is exposed to the sample of moist air, from which it removes
all the water vapor. Then the drying agent is weighed again. The differ-
ence in the two measurements is the weight of moisture removed from
the air sample. As one might imagine, the procedure is highly complex
and time-consuming. The apparatus fills a room, and operation re-
quires several skilled technicians. A single measurement can take
hours, days or weeks to perform — the lower the moisture, the longer
the time required to take the measurement.
The National Institute provides dewpoint certification of instruments,
which are then used to calibrate other devices used in commerce and
industry. But for this purpose, the Institute uses a “Two-pressure Gen-
erator”, which creates air at a controlled dewpoint which is then sent
to the equipment to be calibrated.
Condensation hygrometers
A more common instrument to measure specific humidity is based on
the dewpoint phenomenon. If the temperature and total pressure of the
air is known when its moisture condenses, the specific humidity is
known as well.

trument to measure specific humidity is based on
the dewpoint phenomenon. If the temperature and total pressure of the
air is known when its moisture condenses, the specific humidity is
known as well. At constant pressure, each dewpoint has only a single
value of vapor pressure and moisture content.
In its simplest form, called a dewcup, the condensation hygrometer
duplicates the experiments of Charles LeRoy in 1751. A thin, polished
metal container is filled with liquid, which is progressively cooled by
FIGURE 9.11

adding ice or dry ice. A thermometer measures the liquid temperature,
which is assumed to be the same as the air temperature next to the
outside surface of the container. When condensation forms on the out-
side of the container, the observer notes the liquid temperature, which
is assumed to be the air dewpoint temperature. Although far more ac-
curate and repeatable than taking wet and dry bulb readings, dewcup
readings are equally operator-dependant. There are many uncontrolled
variables, including the observers vision, surface illumination, possible
surface contamination, airflow past the surface, temperature uniformity
of the liquid solution, and re-evaporation of condensate. These all
make it difficult to achieve accurate dewcup readings in the field.

 contamination, airflow past the surface, temperature uniformity
of the liquid solution, and re-evaporation of condensate. These all
make it difficult to achieve accurate dewcup readings in the field.
Manufacturers have improved on this basic principal by automatically
controlling the cooling of the surface, its illumination, the airflow rate
and the coupling of the temperature sensor to the surface. Controlling
these variables make optical dewpoint observations far more repeat-
able.
In addition, the observation of the condensation surface is automated
through electronics. A light-emitting diode shines on the cooled sur-
face. The reflected light is received by a sensitive photocell. When the
photocell senses a reduction in illumination, the instrument assumes
moisture has condensed on the cool surface, scattering the light. The
instrument controls the cooling mechanism to maintain the surface
exactly at the air dewpoint, so it can be displayed continuously.
The electronic dewpoint hygrometer is held by many to be the most
consistently accurate device for continuous measurements across a
broad range of conditions, and is often used to calibrate other instru-
ments. However, there are a few sources of measurement error. One is
contamination on the chilled surface. Most equipment is designed to
compensate for normal light dusting, but if corrosive or hygroscopic
material settles on the polished surface, the reading becomes less accu-
rate.

compensate for normal light dusting, but if corrosive or hygroscopic
material settles on the polished surface, the reading becomes less accu-

device, so if the temperature is very high and the measured dewpoint
very low, the user must be careful to specify adequate cooling capacity
for the expected air temperature range.
Aluminum oxide sensors
These instruments operate on the same principle as capacitance sen-
sors used for indicating relative humidity. The capacitance of a thin
film of aluminum oxide varies with adsorbed water vapor. Sensors
which indicate dewpoint rather than relative humidity are often opti-

relative humidities, and such instruments are often used to measure
dewpoints of -40°F at air temperatures above 300°F which comes from
desiccant dehumidifiers used to dry plastic resins.
Some caution is necessary because the oxide binds water vapor quite
strongly. If an airstream changes from very wet to very dry, the sensor
may take a long time to respond to the change. One should not expect
to take a reading downstream of a cooling coil and then immediately
expect an accurate reading in a dry room held at 70°F and a -20°F
dewpoint. Also, repeated wetting of sensors operating close to satura-
tion can cause chemical changes in the oxide film, which may change
response characteristics. These limitations can be mitigated by keeping
the sensor very dry, and by taking intermittent readings of the air in
question, so the sensor is always “approaching” the correct reading
from below rather than above the true value.
Salt equilibrium sensors
Another specific humidity sensor uses the equilibrium characteristics of
a hygroscopic salt. Lithium chloride is dry when the surrounding air is
approximately 11% relative humidity. When the salt is not in a liquid
solution, its resistance is very high.

a hygroscopic salt. Lithium chloride is dry when the surrounding air is
approximately 11% relative humidity. When the salt is not in a liquid
solution, its resistance is very high.
A saturated salt sensor heats a layer of lithium chloride until it is com-
pletely dry, as determined by measuring its electrical resistance. The
temperature of the salt is measured, which can then be converted to
the specific humidity of the air. For instance, if the salt must be at
100°F to be dry, the sensor assumes the moisture content of the air
must be 26 grains because 26 grains represents 11% rh at 100°.
Such instruments are quite repeatable as long as the salt layer is clean
and uniform, and the temperature sensor is stable. The sensors have a
reputation for requiring maintenance, because their lithium chloride
layer can be depleted if the sensor loses heat at saturated conditions —
the salt becomes saturated and drips off the sensor. Although other
sensors may have the appearance of needing less attention, practicing
engineers have found that all sensors need regular attention and cali-
bration for accurate results.

CHAPTER NINE
Electrolytic hygrometers
These instruments are generally used for measuring extremely low
moisture levels — dewpoints below -50°F. They use an electric current
to break water molecules into their constituent atoms of hydrogen and
oxygen.
A very small and carefully controlled airsteam is directed across a sen-
sor coated with phosphoric anhydride, a powerful desiccant. Two elec-
trodes wound through the desiccant electrolyze the absorbed water
vapor. The current required to keep the desiccant dry is directly propor-
tional to the number of water molecules originally in the air sample.
The technique is very accurate at low dewpoints, where it would be
difficult to use other methods because the amount of moisture is so
small. Electrolytic instruments can distinguish between 100 and 125
parts per million by weight — less than one quarter of one percent
relative humidity at 70°F.
Since electrolytic sensors act on any molecules absorbed by the phos-
phoric anhydride, the reading can be distorted by other contaminants.
Also, since a higher airflow rate will bring a disproportionate number
of water molecules to the desiccant, the sample flow rate must be care-
fully controlled.

Material Moisture Content Sensors
In many dehumidification applications, the goal of the project is to
either dry a solid material or to prevent moisture regain. Either project
can require a measurement of the amount of moisture in a solid rather
than in the air.
There are several methods for measuring moisture content of solids. In
all cases, good sampling methodology is essential, and most require
knowledge of the material’s behavior when perfectly dry. Also, these
methods measure the change in material properties from a known dry
material, so if the identity of the material itself is in question, it will be
difficult to determine moisture content. The one exception is a labora-
tory technique known as Carl Fischer titration.
Coulombic Karl Fischer titration
This method is based on measuring the electrical current required for
the reaction of water with iodine. The reaction is very predictable, re-
quiring 10.71 coulombes for every milligram of water present in a solu-
tion of water, iodine and sulfur dioxide.
FIGURE 9.16

HUMIDITY & MOISTURE INSTRUMENTATION
A representative sample of the solid product is placed in the solution,
which also contains non-reacting hygroscopic solvents to extract the
water from the material. Then the current required for the iodine reac-
tion is measured. The current is proportional to the water extracted
from the material.
While the method is quite accurate, it requires time for the solvents to
extract all the water from the material, so coulombic titration is gener-
ally used to develop baseline data on materials, which is then used to
calibrate other instruments.
Infrared absorption
Water absorbs infrared radiation quite efficiently. The more moisture in
a material, the more infrared radiation it will absorb. If the absorption
characteristics of the dry material are known, the increased absorption
of wet material is directly proportional to the increase in moisture.
Making use of this effect, an infrared emitter shines on solid material
and a photocell measures the reflected energy in two wavelengths —
1.9 microns, for instance, which is absorbed by water, and 1.

Making use of this effect, an infrared emitter shines on solid material
and a photocell measures the reflected energy in two wavelengths —
1.9 microns, for instance, which is absorbed by water, and 1.7 microns,
which is not. Electronic circuits compare the strength of the two sig-
nals, and the difference is proportional to the water content of the ma-
terial. While the absorption rate can vary with temperature, most such
instruments are equipped with temperature sensors and automatically
correct their reading for this variation.
The technique is best used where the product layer is both homoge-
neous and thin. Large bulges in product contain more moisture because
they have more mass. Also, if the top layer exposed to the infrared
energy has a higher or lower moisture content than the layer below,
there can be a false reading of moisture content of the total sample.
Product structure and color can also affect absorption, so optimum
wavelengths are generally different for different materials. But when
sensor arrays are engineered to a single, specific product application,
remarkable accuracy is possible — 0.1% of true surface-moisture con-
tent in many cases.
Equilibrium moisture detectors
Sensors which measure relative humidity of air are also used to make
approximate measurements of moisture in materials. Solids which con-
tain moisture will release it if the surrounding air is very dry, and ab-
sorb more moisture if the air is humid.

its particular structure and chemical composition, its temperature and
the surrounding relative humidity.
If an observer knows the product is neither taking on or giving up
moisture, and also knows the relative humidity of the air, he can esti-
mate the amount of moisture in the material. Since the materials struc-
ture and chemical composition also influence the moisture equilibrium
characteristics, there are separate tables for different materials that
show the moisture content of a given product at different relative
humidities.

characteristics, there are separate tables for different materials that

There are important practical considerations about using a relative
humidity sensor to measure product moisture. First, the sensor must be
in air which is truly in equilibrium with the product. The sensor must
be placed in non-circulating air very close to the product surface. For
instance, in paper storage applications, the sensor is inserted deep into
a stack between the sheets rather than simply read in the warehouse
around the pallets. And in grain, the sensor is thrust deep into the bin
rather than the space above the product. Also, the moisture estimate is
only as good as the equilibrium data for the material in question. If the
equilibrium data for barley is used for soybeans, there will be a signifi-
cant measurement error. In fact, if the data for one corn species is used
for another, the reading may be misleading.
Further, like all material moisture measurements, the usefulness of the
technique depends on the uniformity of the material and the statistical
validity of the sample. For example, even if grain starts out at a per-
fectly uniform moisture content, several months of storage in a large
bin will redistribute moisture because of minute convection currents
and temperature differences in the bin.

may be several percent more moist than grain at the bottom. Several
readings within a large batch are necessary to gain an accurate reading.
Also, large product pieces can be moist on the inside and dry on the
outside, or vice-versa. The relative humidity technique only measures
surface characteristics of the material.
The equilibrium technique is frequently used where the real question is
not the exact moisture content, but rather the change since the last
reading. It allows a relatively fast method of monitoring changes when
an observer knows and understands the probable behavior of the
product.
FIGURE 9.19

Resistance moisture sensors
Solid materials containing moisture will generally conduct electricity.
Their resistance to current flow is inversely proportional to their mois-
ture content — the drier the material, the greater the resistance.
Resistance moisture detectors penetrate the material with two sharp
needles which act as electrodes. A current passes through the material
from one electrode to the other, and the observer notes the resistance
reading. The resistance of the material when totally dry and completely
wet has been pre-established, so the instrument reading indicates
roughly what percent moisture remains in the material.
Different materials require different electrode shapes for proper mois-
ture measurements. For instance, an electrode for paper can be made in
the shape of two flat paddles which contact the paper at a fixed dis-
tance from each other. Electrodes for wood can be needles and for bulk
powders and grain a probe can be designed with electrodes at the end
of a long shaft.
Like other solid moisture measurement techniques, resistance instru-
ments assume the observer has reference data which allows him to
convert a resistance reading to a corresponding moisture value. Also,
the instrument measures resistance between electrodes, which are basi-
cally at the surface of the material.

the instrument measures resistance between electrodes, which are basi-

measure, the electrodes must penetrate deep into the material to avoid
a misleading result.
Wood provides a good example, since moisture content of lumber is
frequently measured with resistance instruments. The end-grain of
lumber absorbs and desorbs moisture faster than the edge grain, and
lumber on the outside of a stack may be much drier or wetter than
boards in the middle. So, measurements should be taken at several
points along a board; and several boards from different places in the
stack should be measured if the observer must establish the average
moisture content of the whole pile.
Finally, the resistance of moisture-laden materials increases with tem-
perature, just as happens in a copper wire. So when the material is
significantly higher or lower than 70°F, the observer must make a tem-
perature correction to the moisture content reading.

CHAPTER NINE
Microwave absorption
Another absorption moisture measurement technique for continuous
product flows uses the fact that microwaves are absorbed by water
much like infrared energy. But where infrared techniques are really
limited to surfaces, microwaves can penetrate into deeper thicknesses
of material.
A microwave generator is mounted on one side of the material. On the
opposite side, a receiver measures the change in microwave amplitude
and the extent of the phase-shift. The amplitude loss divided by the
phase shift is proportional to the moisture in the material.
Since the weight percent of moisture in the material will also vary with
differences in product density, a gamma-ray sender and receiver con-
tinuously measure product density and use the value to correct the
moisture reading. Temperature also affects microwave absorption, so a
third circuit continuously samples product temperature and makes the
appropriate correction.
Microwave and infrared absorption techniques are equally accurate, but
since infrared instruments are generally less costly, microwaves are
typically used in deep beds or dark materials where infrared techniques
have limitations.

Radio frequency (capacitance) sensors
Since the dielectric characteristics of water are very different from most
solids, measuring the characteristics of a given material provide a
means of determining its water content. Water has a high dielectric
constant — which is to say it is easily charged. But it also has a high
dielectric loss, so it quickly loses that charge when the current is re-
moved.
In this technique, a radio frequency generator and electrical oscillating
circuit are combined so that they resonate. When a product is brought
near the instrument, the moisture in the product absorbs energy from
the radio frequency field. This weakens the oscillating circuit so its
voltage peak declines in proportion to the amount of moisture in the
field. Like other absorption techniques, radio frequency attenuation is
affected by product temperature, so the circuit must adjust for that
variable.
Ideally, the field should be presented with the most uniform and repro-
ducible moist sample possible. Therefore, for best results the actual
shape of the RF generator must be fitted to each application.

C. Temperature and humidity levels at this location are comparatively easy to measure.
The problem will be to make sure the air is well-mixed at the sensor location.
D. Immediately downstream of a Honeycombe
® desiccant dehumidifier, the air is
highly stratified in both temperature and moisture, the average temperature is high
and the humidity very low. An aluminum oxide dewpoint sensor might do well in this
location as long as the air is well-mixed before the sensor. The typical measurement at
this point is well outside the range of relative humidity sensors.
E & F. Taking a humidity measurement downstream of a fan or dry cooling coil is easier
duty than immediately following a dehumidifier, but on system start-up, the coil may
well run at saturation for a time, as it will if the dehumidifier should stop. The sensor
must tolerate saturation in this location, and good air mixing after a cooling coil is also
essential.
G, H, I, J. Note how air distribution and concentrated heat and moisture loads can
affect the conditions immediately surrounding a sensor.

G, H, I, J. Note how air distribution and concentrated heat and moisture loads can
affect the conditions immediately surrounding a sensor. Perfect mixing throughout the
room is not possible, so sensors should be placed away from obvious load extremes,
unless control at those locations is essential.
M. The reactivation air leaving a dehumidifier seems moderate in terms of relative
humidity, but when the unit shuts off, the massive amount of moisture in the duct will
condense as the air cools. This is an extremely harsh environment for a humidity
sensor — high temperature, intermittent condensation and possible corrosives in the
airstream. Most systems require only temperature measurements at this location.

General Observations
Sensor placement
Moisture and humidity sensors are only as useful as the results they
achieve in practice. Product specifications are meaningless unless the
units are properly applied. Most common difficulties with moisture
sensors are avoided by calibrating them in the environment where they
will be used, and within the range of expected measurement. The sec-
ond most common problem is poor sensor placement.
In a humidity-controlled space or product, there may be a wide range
of possible moisture conditions. Figure 9.23 illustrates these points.
The caption for that figure offers some suggestions on sensors for dif-
ferent locations.

of possible moisture conditions. Figure 9.23 illustrates these points.
The caption for that figure offers some suggestions on sensors for dif-
ferent locations.
In taking measurements of product moisture content, the same caution
applies. Recognize that moisture content is not necessarily uniform
across the product surface or through its depth. If accuracy or uniform
dryness is important, it will be essential to take several readings within
the product to understand its moisture characteristics.
Measuring moisture below 10% relative humidity
Cautions concerning sensor placement are especially important when
the control level is very low, because moisture differences can be large
between different points in the space. For instance, people’s respiration
will raise moisture levels around work spaces, and the air outlet from
the dehumidification system will be exceptionally dry. Additionally,
since there is very little moisture in the air, an instrument may take
longer to register a humidity change.
For instance, the moisture difference between 50% relative humidity
and 55% at 70°F is six grains per pound. However, in a room manufac-
turing surgical sutures, the difference between an acceptable -20°F
dewpoint and an unacceptable -15°F dewpoint is less than 0.06 grains
per pound, which is 100 times less than the difference between 50 and
55% relative humidity. This means the sensor may take longer to regis-
ter the change.

ble -15°F dewpoint is less than 0.06 grains
per pound, which is 100 times less than the difference between 50 and
55% relative humidity. This means the sensor may take longer to regis-
ter the change. The instrument must be much more sensitive to begin
with, and details which might appear minor become more significant
— such as the sampling system.
In many low-humidity rooms, a costly instrument is installed in a cen-
tral location, and an air pump pulls several samples from the room
through a manifold, so several points can be measured in turn. But at
Sensor placement is even more important
than sensor accuracy. For instance, a
dehumidifier installation to protect steel
from rusting failed to prevent the
problem. The technician investigated, and
found the dehumidifier was located 75
feet from the storage racks, but the
humidistat controlling the unit was
mounted near the dry air discharge. The
dehumidifier kept the discharge duct free
of rust, but $50,000 worth of steel had to
be reworked before the humidistat was
relocated onto the storage racks.

very low levels, it may take many hours or even days for the sample
tubing to dry out so it does not distort the room reading. Figure 9.25
shows how a metal sampling tube can dry within hours, but nylon
tubing may take days to dry low enough for dewpoint readings below -
40°F. For this reason, instrument manufacturers generally insist on
stainless steel sample tubing for measuring below -20°F dewpoints.
Environmental chambers
One of the most difficult tasks in moisture measurement is indicating
and controlling humidity in an environmental simulation chamber. Such
devices create a very wide range of temperature and moisture condi-
tions, and they may change frequently and rapidly between different
points. This is very heavy duty for moisture measurement instrumenta-
tion, and if accuracy is essential, it is important to calibrate the sensors
regularly. Also, when the sensors must span a wide range, it is best to
calibrate them at several points within that range for best results.

ehumidification equipment and systems can provide very large
benefits for a wide variety of applications — a fact which has
been discussed in Chapter 4. However, there is no benefit with-
out investment, and in many cases, the investment in dehumidification
equipment can be substantial. The design engineer and equipment
owner are quite naturally concerned with minimizing the equipment
investment, and maximizing its benefits.
The costs and benefits of any expenditure are never absolute — they
are relative to the costs and benefits of other courses of action. The
most common alternative to a dehumidification project is making no
investment at all — which in many cases is the most costly of all pos-
sible courses of action.

CHAPTER TEN
Identifying & Quantifying
Economic Benefits
Economic benefits of a dehumidification project are as diverse as the
number of applications for the equipment. But in general, they fall into
four principal categories:
• Operational cost reduction
• Capital equipment cost reduction
• Product quality improvements
• Operational response improvements
All of these translate directly to either improved profits, or the ability to
reallocate expensive resources to other uses. The effect of economic
benefits multiplied over the 20-year life of dehumidification equipment
can be quite astonishing. We will look at each of the areas in turn.
Operational cost reduction
Global competition has put a premium on keeping operational costs to
a minimum. Dehumidification projects often assist in this goal. For
example:
Interruption costs
Many dehumidification projects are initiated to reduce interruption
costs. Where capital equipment is a large cost of operation, it must be
in use constantly to assure profitable operation.

tion costs
Many dehumidification projects are initiated to reduce interruption
costs. Where capital equipment is a large cost of operation, it must be
in use constantly to assure profitable operation.
When a ship is in drydock for painting, the cost of “demurrage
charges” can be over $20,000 per day. A dehumidification project to
speed painting may save several days or even weeks of these charges.
Semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing is often so sensitive
to moisture that excessive humidity forces a halt to operation. Lost
production time can cost over $40,000 per day.
Businesses often invest in “interruption insurance” to cover the lost
production in case of fire, flood or other disaster. Again, the cost to the
insurance company can exceed $10,000 per day. Using a dehumidifier
to speed drying of an office or production equipment can return the
business to operation quickly, avoiding very large insurance claims,
and speeding resumption of profitable business operation.
Production freezers must occasionally halt operation to defrost machin-
ery and conveyors. If this happens in the middle of a shift, dozens of
workers are made idle. The cost of labor and capital cost of equipment

which allows a manager to schedule defrost may save over $1,000 per
hour of downtime.
Reducing re-work
If material becomes damaged by high humidity, the product or ma-
chine may have to be re-worked before it can be used or sold. In one
classic case, the edges of coated steel coils corroded in storage, damag-
ing the electrical properties of the steel for use in transformers.

classic case, the edges of coated steel coils corroded in storage, damag-
ing the electrical properties of the steel for use in transformers. The
dimension was critical, so it was not possible to simply grind off the
corrosion. Coils had to be re-slit to a different dimension, loosing mate-
rial and disrupting production. The cost saving from dehumidifying the
warehouse was $250,000 per year.
Reducing energy costs
Desiccant dehumidifiers can utilize low-cost sources of energy to re-
move moisture from air, which can save money compared to other
methods. In supermarkets, refrigerated cases remove moisture from the
store, but not efficiently. Desiccant units can save over $30,000 per year
in store energy costs.
Desiccant units are often combined with vapor-compression cooling
systems to provide operating efficiencies. Refrigeration systems work
more efficiently at high evaporator temperatures. When a desiccant
dehumidifier feeds a cooling system with dry air, the cooling system
can be set to a relatively high temperature because it need not dehu-
midify the air. This improves the operating efficiency of the refrigera-
tion system, saving thousands of dollars each month on large systems.
Reducing need for skilled labor
In many situations, labor costs for maintaining equipment are high
because of the effect of humidity. For example, aircraft avionics can
change calibration with minute corrosion of circuits and connectors.

The personnel needed to re-calibrate such instruments are scarce and
expensive. Controlling humidity can free this resource, saving thou-
sands of dollars per month in labor costs.
Maintenance costs
Maintenance budgets are often based on past practices that may be
unnecessary with proper humidity control. For example, it can cost
over $1,000,000 to blast and paint a marine tanker or process chemical
plant. A dehumidifier improves coating adhesion, which can double
the life of the coating. This may mean a maintenance cost saving of
several million dollars over the 20 to 40 year plant or ship’s useful life.
201
MINIMIZING COSTS & MAXIMIZING BENEFITS
Packaging machinery processing hygroscopic material like candy, fertil-
izers and powders must frequently be cleaned by maintenance person-
nel. The cost of the operation gets lost in maintenance budgets, but it
can be quite substantial. A dehumidification project which reduces
cleaning time also reduces operational costs.
Reduced worker’s compensation insurance costs
Refrigerated warehouses with icy floors can have larger than normal
costs for worker’s compensation claims. A dehumidification project can
reduce such uncontrolled costs, and benefit the operation through im-
proved worker morale.

Indoor air quality problems in some buildings stem from microbial
growth in cool, moist air distribution systems. Drying this air with a
desiccant dehumidifier can reduce the problem, saving the cost of sick
time and worker’s compensation claims that result from humidity-
related health hazards.
Reducing cost of capital investments
Many organizations are limited in their access to funds for capital ex-
penditures. While dehumidification projects generally fall into this cat-
egory, such equipment is often far less costly than other capital
expenditures to accomplish the same goal. For example:
Reduced need for plant expansion
Some dehumidification projects speed production enough to eliminate
the need for a complete second factory. For instance, dropping the cool-
ant temperature in the “chill box” of a photographic film coating line
can double the coating speed, essentially doubling production from the
same equipment. A dehumidifier that prevents condensation on cold
surfaces allows this capacity increase, which avoids the need for a sec-
ond coating line. Coating equipment may cost between $10 and $50
million to install, without including the cost of additional personnel
and operating expenses.

Equivalent productivity improvements are possible in plastic injection
molding operations, which have similar costs for new plants and equip-
ment. A dehumidification project for existing equipment can avoid both
the cost and time required for major plant expansions.
Reduced equipment replacement costs
In many industries, it is common practice to replace equipment on a
regular basis. However, the cost of such policies can be difficult to
bear when access to capital becomes limited. For instance, hotels and
202
CHAPTER TEN
motels assume that mold and mildew as well as normal wear and tear
will require replacement of room furnishings on a regular basis. Pre-
venting mold and mildew has allowed certain chains to extend the
useful life of furnishings, reducing the need for capital expenditure.
Military equipment provides an even more dramatic example. Rusted
ammunition, humidity-damaged missile motors and corroded airframe
components can force premature replacement of multi-million dollar
supplies and equipment. Armed forces do not always have the re-
sources to re-purchase such costly gear. A dehumidification project
which eliminates these problems can create a major opportunity for
resource reallocation.

Reduced HVAC system installed costs
Standard heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems can increase
in cost when humidity control is important. For example, if a building
has only a few spaces which must be humidity-controlled, but a central
chilled water system serves all spaces, it will be necessary to run the
chiller at a low temperature to provide dehumidification. Adding a
desiccant dehumidifier to control only those humidity-sensitive opera-
tions allows the designer to use a much smaller chiller to control sen-
sible temperature and dehumidification for comfort in the balance of
the building, for a net installed system cost savings.
Also, in process applications, solvents are often used to speed drying
rates for products. Investment casting operations provide a good ex-
ample. Either solvents or water can be used in ceramic casting slurries
that form the investment casting molds. But if solvents are used, an
expensive emission-control system is necessary to comply with air pol-
lution regulations. Using water-based slurries — with a low-humidity
level to speed drying — a plant can avoid the high equipment and op-
erational costs of emission-control systems.

Reduced commercial building retrofit costs
In recent years, businesses have made large investments in office auto-
mation in the form of personal computers, printers, copiers and FAX
machines. In many cases, this has doubled the sensible heat load in-
side commercial buildings. Some owners have also concluded they
must increase outside air ventilation rates to avoid loss of worker pro-
ductivity through health problems. This also increases the total latent
and sensible heat loads on older buildings, overloading the original
mechanical systems beyond their design limits.
203
MINIMIZING COSTS & MAXIMIZING BENEFITS
Desiccant dehumidifiers are used to off-load the latent heat load from
the system by pre-drying the ventilation air to very low levels. The dry
air has a large capacity for dehumidification, which means the existing
ductwork does not have to be replaced to gain latent capacity. Also,
since thermal energy can be used to regenerate the desiccant and re-
move the latent heat load, the owner can often avoid the large cost of
upgrading the electrical distribution system to add cooling capacity.
Improved profits through improved quality
The value of many products and services is increased through the use
of dehumidification equipment.

Improved profits through improved quality
The value of many products and services is increased through the use
of dehumidification equipment. This value can be converted to higher
profits, which may not be achievable under other circumstances, or if
possible, may cost more than using dehumidification equipment. Some
examples include:
Improved market image through product appearance
Premium chocolate products have a fine, polished surface for maxi-
mum product appeal. These are worth more to the consumer than
those with a blotchy finish caused by condensation in cooling tunnels
or in coating pans. The difference can mean millions of dollars in profit
opportunity for manufacturers who invest in dehumidification technol-
ogy. Also, the cost of marketing to build brand image can be vast, and
less than optimum product appearance can make these expenditures
useless.
Reduced scrap rate
In some production operations, it is not important to manufacture high-
quality goods. However, many international manufacturers have the
opinion that “quality is free”. This is to say that reducing scrap and
smoothing out manufacturing with production tooling investments
pays its cost back very rapidly. Like other tooling investments, dehu-
midification projects can be assessed against the cost of the scrap they
eliminate.

CHAPTER TEN
Higher product value
The mechanical, chemical or biological properties of some products
can be enhanced through the use of dehumidification equipment. For
instance, enzymes used in food processing and bio-engineering applica-
tions deteriorate with heat. Using a dehumidifier to dry enzymes at low
temperatures allows the material to retain full potency. This means that
a given amount of the enzyme will accomplish more work than mate-
rial dried using high temperatures. The more potent enzyme is worth
more in the market than the less potent material.
The germination rate of seeds also depends to large extent on drying
temperature. Seeds dried at low temperatures using dehumidifiers ger-
minate at a higher rate, so they are worth more than seeds dried at
high temperatures. The value of spices, tea and other high-value agri-
cultural products can be enhanced in the same way. The increased
profit potential is a direct benefit of the dehumidification equipment.

Many companies operate in a business environment which puts a pre-
mium on fast response to sudden changes in market demand. Dehu-
midification projects can contribute to fast response, which has a direct
relationship to improved profits. For example:
Power generation
Electrical demand can vary widely throughout the year, and even
within a month or week. Producing excess power is not profitable, so
certain peak load generators are often shut down. However, key com-
ponents can corrode when out of use. Dehumidifiers which prevent
corrosion without the need for greases or vapor-phase inhibitors allow
a generator set to be instantly restarted at full capacity in response to
changing load conditions, which avoids high costs for peak power pur-
chased from other sources for short periods.
Un-scheduled maintenance of civilian aircraft
A large proportion of maintenance problems in aircraft are humidity-
related, including avionics failures, structural corrosion and turbine-
blade and bolt corrosion. The cost to pull an aircraft out of service is
very large, particularly when there is no replacement aircraft available.

MINIMIZING COSTS & MAXIMIZING BENEFITS
Military mission-capability
At any given time, some percentage of military equipment is not fully
mission-capable. Dehumidification projects to increase this availability
mean fewer tanks, planes or artillery pieces can perform the same mis-
sion with great reductions in both capital expenditure and maintenance
costs. Improved mission-readiness also has the obvious advantage of
saving lives in times of conflict.
Crop storage
Most agricultural products are worth less at time of harvest than later,
when supplies have been depleted. Protecting such products with de-
humidifiers until market demand is high increases the product value
greatly in excess of the cost of the equipment even in a single season.
Minimizing costs
Assuming everything possible has been done to maximize the benefits
of the dehumidification project, the system designer’s attention shifts to
insuring the project will use the minimum resources necessary to
achieve the intended benefits. There are two areas of concern — first
cost and operating cost.

insuring the project will use the minimum resources necessary to
achieve the intended benefits. There are two areas of concern — first
cost and operating cost.
Often the designer must make difficult decisions when the goal of low
operating cost may conflict with a limited project budget. It is painful
to be presented with a situation where the organization simply cannot
afford the cost of an additional control which might pay back its cost
within a month of installation. However, dealing with those situations
are beyond the scope of this handbook. Our discussion will center on
what can be done — once resources have been made available — to
make sure overall costs are minimized.
Minimizing first cost
In principle, first costs can be minimized by removing only the mini-
mum moisture necessary to achieve the desired benefits, and by remov-
ing it in the most efficient manner possible. In practice, this means the
designer should concentrate on:
• Minimizing moisture loads
• Optimizing the control levels and maximizing tolerances
• Drying outside air before it enters the controlled space
• Combining refrigerant and desiccant-based dehumidification equipment

CHAPTER TEN
Minimizing moisture loads
The refrigerated warehouse example in Chapter 7 provides an example
of how to minimize moisture loads to minimize first cost. In that ex-
ample, the designer is faced with the fact that existing warehouse load-
ing door practices will create an enormous moisture load. The project
could never hope to proceed because the company could not afford the
equipment no matter how great the potential benefit. In the example,
the designer makes a change in the maximum allowable time a door
can be open, and the moisture load drops to less than half the original
calculation, reducing the capital cost by more than 50%.
The example is fictitious, and most designers do not have direct control
over door activity, but the principle is sound — when capital is limited,
the designer should go through the moisture load calculation sheet
very carefully. It may be possible to limit door activity, reduce exhaust
fan airflow or tighten the building envelope at very low cost compared
to building a larger system to remove a large moisture load.
Laboratory exhaust hoods are particularly costly because they generate
a requirement for dry make-up air to replace the exhausted air. Often,
the open area of the hood can be reduced without compromising ex-
perimental or process requirements.

ostly because they generate
a requirement for dry make-up air to replace the exhausted air. Often,
the open area of the hood can be reduced without compromising ex-
perimental or process requirements.
This is a difficult tightrope for the designer to walk — one must not be
overly optimistic about possible future changes to existing buildings
and established practices. Still, some large loads can be easily reduced
by low-cost application of building sealants, aluminum foil tape and
vapor-retarders.
Optimizing control levels and maximizing tolerances
As the moisture control level reduces, the engineer should be more and
more careful not to over-specify the dewpoint or the tolerance. This is
particularly true at dewpoints below 0°F (5.5 gr/lb). Even if air could
be delivered at zero moisture content, the amount of dry air necessary
to remove a given moisture load increases as the control level goes
down. This means much larger dehumidification systems for the same
load.
For example, if the space has an internal moisture load of one pound
per hour, and the control level is 5.5 gr/lb, it would require 283 cfm of
perfectly dry air to remove the load and to maintain control. If the con-
trol level is reduced to a -15°F dewpoint (2.5 gr/lb), the system will
need 622 cfm, and at a -27°F dewpoint (1.2 gr/lb), the airflow must be
1296 cfm — all this represents a larger first cost for no increase in
moisture load.

As the control level declines, it takes more
dry air to remove the same load. System
cost is roughly proportional to air quantity.

MINIMIZING COSTS & MAXIMIZING BENEFITS
Tolerances are another area for scrutiny by the cost-conscious designer,
and like control levels, the cost of over-specifying rises dramatically as
the control level goes down and the tolerances tighten. Also, confusion
in a tolerance specification can be very costly.
For example, consider an environmental simulation chamber specifica-
tion calling for a room control level of 15 gr/lb, with a tolerance of ± 5
gr/lb. The specification can have two meanings. One supplier may
interpret the designer’s intention as “the moisture condition at the dis-
charge where air enters the space must not vary from the specified
level by more than ± 5 gr/lb.” A second supplier may interpret the
specification to mean “the moisture condition throughout the room
must be uniform.

level by more than ± 5 gr/lb.” A second supplier may interpret the
specification to mean “the moisture condition throughout the room
must be uniform. It cannot vary by more than 5 gr/lb from any one
point in the room to any other.”
The first supplier can satisfy the specification by delivering any amount
of air — probably a small amount — at a condition of 15 gr/lb. The
control level in the rest of the room may rise well above the 20 grains
implied, but not made explicit by the specification. The second supplier
will provide enough air to remove the specified load while maintaining
no more than a 5 grain differential from system outlet to system inlet.
This will be a much more costly system.
The designer can save a great deal through conversations with equip-
ment suppliers concerning the effect of different specifications on sys-
tem cost. This is particularly true as the moisture control level moves
down to very low dewpoints.
Combining refrigeration and desiccant-based dehumidification
equipment
Often, refrigeration-based dehumidification systems are cost-effective
for moisture removal above a 50°F dewpoint. At lower levels, desiccant
equipment is probably more efficient. However, most humidity control
systems cross this line as wet ventilation air is brought into a building
with a low moisture control level. The designer should consider using a
combined system.

systems cross this line as wet ventilation air is brought into a building
with a low moisture control level. The designer should consider using a
combined system. In many cases, a system which uses both technolo-
gies will be less expensive to install and operate than one which uses
either desiccants or refrigeration exclusively. This is particularly true
for large building air conditioning systems. Chapter 8 described this
optimization process in detail.

The specification calls for a moisture control
level of 15 gr/lb ±5 gr/lb, but it fails to
define where that will be measured —  in the
room, at the air supply diffuser or at the
return air grill. As the control level declines,
such ambiguities can lead to different
system designs from different suppliers.

Minimizing operating cost
Reducing operating cost to a minimum is — like reducing installation
cost — a matter of limiting load, and using the least expensive energy
sources to remove it. Some aspects of this task are beyond the control
of a system designer, since they involve the way a system is operated,
or the way a production process must change from original assump-
tions.

ove it. Some aspects of this task are beyond the control
of a system designer, since they involve the way a system is operated,
or the way a production process must change from original assump-
tions. The designer, however, does control the most important methods
of minimizing operational costs — modulating energy in response to
load changes, and using the lowest-cost energy sources available.
Energy modulation in response to load changes
The idea of purchasing a car without an accelerator pedal or transmis-
sion gearbox is almost inconceivable. But with imagination, one can
picture the comic effect of lurching down the street with only an on-off
switch and brake to control the engine’s power. Yet until recent years, it
was quite common for dehumidification systems to be designed with-
out controls to modulate dehumidifier capacity, reactivation energy and
cooling.
The importance of energy modulation depends on the size of the sys-
tem, and on the nature of the load changes. Some systems — like those
for long-term storage — may need nothing more than an on-off switch,
because the loads are small and relatively constant, and there is no
economic benefit to control precision in a narrow range. Other systems
— such as those for semiconductor manufacturing — place a high pre-
mium on control precision, and the majority of the load comes from
the ventilation air, which changes radically over short time spans.

such as those for semiconductor manufacturing — place a high pre-
mium on control precision, and the majority of the load comes from
the ventilation air, which changes radically over short time spans.
Even when control precision is not an issue, deciding when to be con-
cerned about energy modulation is fairly straightforward. Compare the
annual cost of running the non-modulated system with its installed
cost. When annual energy cost is a high percentage of the installed
cost, modulate energy in response to load. Such control will probably
reduce the annual energy cost by 25 to 50%.
In a rotary desiccant dehumidifier, reactivation energy can be modu-
lated by reducing either the flow rate or the temperature of air entering
the reactivation sector. The signal to reduce energy comes from a tem-
perature sensor mounted in the air leaving reactivation. Since air picks
up moisture in reactivation, its sensible temperature goes down — just
as air temperature around a sprinkler is reduced in summertime as the
air picks up moisture. The temperature drop is proportional to the
moisture pick-up. If there is less moisture to pick up, the reactivation

air temperature will remain high, which indicates less energy is
needed. So, as reactivation outlet temperature rises, the temperature
sensor signals the control system to reduce reactivation energy.
There are two levels of energy modulation for desiccant systems. The
first level could be called “reactivation load following” control. This is
the control system described above — the reactivation heat is reduced
as the moisture load from process declines. This control system is the
lowest in cost and the highest in benefit.
The next level could be called “equipment reconfiguration” control.
When loads are lower than design, moisture removal efficiency (mea-
sured in Btu’s per lb of water removed) declines. This is similar to us-
ing a large dump truck to deliver a bag of groceries — the mass of the
machinery must still be moved a given distance, but the payload is
smaller.

cation system for improved performance at low-load conditions by
using a variety of sensors, microprocessors and variable speed motors
for fans, refrigeration components and desiccant drives. The cost of
such a system is quite high compared to the benefits, but extremely
large systems may benefit enough in absolute dollar terms to justify the
cost. For smaller installations, the strategy outlined in the next para-
graph is often more cost-effective than installing such an “equipment
reconfiguration” control system.
Multiple systems for disparate loads
Another way to reduce operating cost on a large installation is to match
the equipment more closely to the loads in each part of the system.
Borrowing another analogy from transportation, imagine the benefits of
a railroad compared to a fleet of trucks. The railroad has advantages
when loads are heavy, continuous and always travel the same path.
The trucks have advantages when loads and their locations are very
diverse and intermittent. In the second situation, the railroad would be
prohibitively large and expensive to meet diverse needs.

prohibitively large and expensive to meet diverse needs. Likewise,
large, centralized dehumidification systems are cost-effective when
loads are constant and continuous, but where there are diverse circum-
stances, the designer may want to consider separate smaller systems.
For example, imagine a cool, humidity-controlled brewery cellar with a
constant moisture load from ventilation air brought into the space to
remove carbon dioxide gas from fermentation. Occasionally, the brew-
ing equipment is washed down and cleaned, temporarily adding a mas-

tive to design the basic system for the maximum weather load, and add
a separate, much smaller dehumidifier to operate only when the basic
system cannot handle a simultaneous peak of internal and ventilation
loads.
Utilizing low-cost reactivation energy
Energy consumed by a desiccant dehumidification system is used in
three places: electrical power for fans and pumps, electrical or thermal
energy for cooling, and thermal energy for desiccant reactivation. Reac-
tivation is the largest energy consumer (in terms of Btu’s), and many
creative methods have been developed to minimize its cost.
Beginning with the least-cost source, a system designer can re-use en-
ergy that has already been paid for by recovering heat from cogenera-
tion systems, refrigeration condensers or the reactivation process itself.
In a rotating desiccant unit, the air leaving reactivation is quite hot and
moist. The designer can place an air-to-air heat exchanger between the
air entering and leaving reactivation to recover this exhaust energy for
re-use. For a very modest investment in a heat exchanger, the engineer
can recover 60 to 80% of the energy the system has already used once
— surely the lowest-cost energy source available.

In a liquid desiccant unit, a liquid-to-liquid type heat exchanger can be
placed between the warm desiccant leaving the regenerator and the
cooler desiccant entering the regenerator. This has a doubly beneficial
effect. Less energy is needed to regenerate the desiccant, because it is
warmer than when it left the conditioner. And less energy is needed to
cool the process air, because the desiccant returning to the conditioner
is cooler than when it left the regenerator.
Refrigeration condensers reject heat from the air-cooling process. This
energy can be used to pre-heat the air entering the reactivation sector
of a dehumidifier. Refrigeration systems often include a “de-superheat-
ing” coil to cool the refrigerant as it moves between the compressor
and condenser. This coil can be arranged so the rejected heat passes to
the air entering the reactivation sector of the desiccant unit.
Cogeneration of electrical power also rejects heat that can be used to
reactivate — or partially reactivate — a desiccant dehumidifier. Such
generators are often powered by engines that reject heat to a water-
based cooling system. The hot water from this system can be used to

In short, any heat rejected from another process can be used to mini-
mize the cost of regenerating a desiccant dehumidifier. Also, the de-
signer can seek out other low-cost sources of heat. For example, utility
costs can vary throughout the year, depending on the supply and de-
mand at the time. In some European countries, electrical power is very
inexpensive during the summer — just when desiccant regeneration
demand is high. In parts of the U.S. and many developing countries,
there is an abundant supply of natural gas in summertime, so the cost
to use that energy for desiccant reactivation can be very low.
Many industrial plants as well as commercial and institutional build-
ings have boilers which must be operated year-round to support pro-
cess heating needs. Since there is virtually no comfort-heating
requirement in summertime, this “nearly-waste” energy can be used to
regenerate a desiccant system at very low cost. Also, clean, warm ex-
haust air can be used for desiccant regeneration directly. For example,
many large mechanical rooms are cooled by ventilation fans even dur-
ing winter months. This air can be used for desiccant regeneration
instead of colder weather air, saving considerable energy cost.
Staged reactivation
To fully reactivate a desiccant, the material must be raised to a rela-
tively high temperature. But this high temperature is only necessary to
remove the last portion of the water, which is tightly bound by the
desiccant.

stage reactivation process to remove 70 to 80% of the water with
low-grade heat, and can accomplish only the final drying with high-
cost heat.
Desiccant energy storage
In a liquid desiccant system, it is possible to purchase extra desiccant
and holding tanks beyond regular requirements, regenerating the liquid
when energy is inexpensive and storing it until there is a need for more
moisture removal capacity. This stores the latent capacity of a building
HV AC system in the form of dry desiccant just like sensible cooling
capacity can be stored by making ice at off-peak rates with a refrigera-

CHAPTER TEN
Utilizing low-cost cooling
A desiccant system often needs cooling where temperature as well as
humidity must be controlled. The designer can minimize this energy
cost by using indirect evaporative cooling, by using thermal energy to
drive an absorption cooling system, or by increasing cooling system
efficiency through raising the refrigerant evaporator temperature.
Indirect evaporative cooling cools air by adding water to it by passing it
through a spray, mist or through contact with a wet surface. The cool
air in turn cools either water or another airstream through a heat ex-
changer. Large buildings often use cooling towers — indirect evapora-
tive coolers — to obtain low-cost cooling for industrial processes or
refrigeration systems. Dehumidification systems can also make use of
existing cooling towers to cool air or liquid desiccant solutions.
Absorption cooling systems use low-cost thermal energy to cool air or
water. Such systems form a closed loop like a vapor-compression refrig-
eration system. Water is the refrigerant gas instead of the more com-
mon halocarbon gases. Inside the system, water evaporates from one
section, because it is attracted to a desiccant in another.

ig-
eration system. Water is the refrigerant gas instead of the more com-
mon halocarbon gases. Inside the system, water evaporates from one
section, because it is attracted to a desiccant in another. This evapora-
tion removes heat from air on the other side of a cooling coil. This
cooling effect can be used to remove heat from the desiccant dehumidi-
fication process, just as vapor-compression refrigeration removes heat
from air and fluids.
Desiccant dehumidification systems can also use cooling from more-
efficient vapor-compression systems. Such systems often cool air to low
dewpoints for dehumidification. When a desiccant unit removes the
moisture, the cooling system may be able to operate at higher evapora-
tor temperatures, which improves efficiency and lowers costs.
Operational considerations
If the system designer is also in charge of its operation, there is much
he or she can do to minimize operational costs. Even when that is not
the case, the designer has an obligation to the organization to make
clear the economic consequences of operating the system in different
ways.
If a freezer door were open, the homeowner would not expect the ice
cream to stay frozen. Likewise, if the door to a humidity-controlled
space is opened frequently, the humidity level can be expected to rise,
and the dehumidification system must use more energy to remove the
load.

 frozen. Likewise, if the door to a humidity-controlled
space is opened frequently, the humidity level can be expected to rise,
and the dehumidification system must use more energy to remove the
load. Devices as simple as a door sign reminding personnel to keep the
door shut tight have effectively reduced operational costs.

MINIMIZING COSTS & MAXIMIZING BENEFITS
Adding a fume hood to a humidity-controlled room means more air will
have to be brought into the room to replace the air exhausted through
the hood. This increases the moisture load, which increases the operat-
ing expense. If exhaust air can be avoided, it will minimize operational
costs.
Desiccant dehumidifiers are such basically simple and reliable devices
that normal preventive maintenance is often forgotten. Lack of mainte-
nance creates very high costs when key components eventually fail
through lack of simple attention — just like a car’s engine will fail
when operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without oil changes.
Regardless of the type of dehumidifier, two tasks must be accomplished
regularly — changing dirty filters and lubricating drive motors and fans
or pumps.
Without this minimal attention, desiccants clog, heaters burn out and
motors seize up, costing thousands or tens of thousands of dollars
where less than a hundred dollars worth of maintenance time over a
year could have avoided the problems.
Summary
Dehumidification projects are not without expense.

where less than a hundred dollars worth of maintenance time over a
year could have avoided the problems.
Summary
Dehumidification projects are not without expense. Like any effort,
there is an investment of time and money required before the benefits
will be achieved. The designer’s work is made easier if he or she can
identify and quantify the benefits, and minimize the costs of a project.
The concepts and suggestions outlined in this chapter are summarized
in the following checklists.
FIGURE 10.9
Operations management
Operations personnel can minimize system
cost by two simple methods —  keeping the
door closed, which minimizes moisture
load, and performing regular filter changes
and drive lubrication. Desiccant
dehumidifiers are surprisingly durable and
trouble-free when minimal maintenance is
performed on a regular basis.
